MUD is a framework for complex Ethereum applications.

It adds some conventions for organizing data and logic and abstracts away low-level complexities so you can focus on the features of your app.

It standardizes the way data is stored on-chain.
With this standard data model, MUD can provide all network code to synchronize contract and client state. This includes synchronizing state directly from an RPC node or a general-purpose MUD indexer.

MUD is MIT-licensed, open source and free to use.

## Features

![MUD features](./public/docs/features.png)

### Today

- State synchronization between contracts and clients without custom networking code
- General purpose indexers (without custom indexing code)
- Seamless contract upgrades (+ automatic contract upgrades during development)
- Shared contract state
- Optimistic updates
- Automatic type generation for contracts and systems
- Query language to interact with contract state
- Data explorer to inspect and modify contract and local state
- Bitpacking utilities

### Soon

- Local simulation of transactions (including optimistic state)
- Built-in support for account abstraction
- Contract package manager

## Quickstart

```
yarn create mud my-project
```

## Packages

MUD consists of several libraries. They can be used independently, but are best used together.

```
cd mud && yarn
```

### Pull requests

MUD follows the [conventional commit specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages and PR titles. Please keep the scope of your PR small (rather open multiple small PRs than one huge PR) and follow the conventional commit spec.
