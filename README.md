MUD is a framework for ambitious Ethereum applications.
It compresses the complexity of building EVM apps with a tightly integrated software stack that handles data storage, upgrades, delegations, etc.

You can see MUD's features, both those available and those still in development, on [the development status page](https://status.mud.dev/).

## Quickstart
