# Mud

Mud is a toolkit for building on-chain worlds

### How to start a new Mud project

1. Add the Github package registry: `npm login --scope=@latticexyz --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com`
2. Bootstrap a new mud project: `npx @latticexyz/cli create <project>`. This will create a new mud project in `./<project>`, so make sure you're not in some other project.

Steps 1 is only for the initial setup. Next time you want to set up a new mud project, just run step 2.

# TODO

- Include general Mud and ECS documentation in the doc publish workflow.
