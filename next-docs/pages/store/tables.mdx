# Tables

<TableIntro />

Tables are registered in the `Store` contract at runtime.
When a table is registered, its ID, key and value types, as well as key and field names are stored in the internal `Tables` table.
This emits an event that can be used by [offchain indexers](../services/indexer) to start replicating the state of the new table.

The recommended way of reading from tables and writing to tables is via the [typed table libraries](./table-libraries).
However, it is also possible to use the low-level `IStore` (external) or `StoreCore` (internal) [API](./reference) directly.

## Types of tables

There are two types of tables in `Store`: _Onchain tables_ and _offchain tables_.
We often omit the prefix from onchain tables and just call them tables.

As the name suggests, **onchain tables** store their state onchain, in the `Store` contract.
In addition, an event is emitted on every write operation, to allow [offchain indexers](../services/indexer) to replicate the onchain state.

**Offchain tables** on the other hand don't store any state onchain, but only emit the events for [offchain indexers](../services/indexer).
This makes them suitable for use cases where data doesn't need to be retrieved onchain, but should still be synchronized from the `Store` contract to [offchain indexers](../services/indexer).

Onchain you can write to offchain tables with the same methods as onchain tables, except for reading data and modifying partial data in a dynamic field.

</Callout>

### Table ID

The table ID encodes the table's type and name in a 32-byte `ResourceId` value and uniquely identifies a table.

```solidity copy
import { ResourceId, ResourceIdLib } from "@latticexyz/store/src/ResourceId.sol";
import { RESOURCE_TABLE, RESOURCE_OFFCHAIN_TABLE } from "@latticexyz/store/src/storeResourceTypes.sol";

// Using the `RESOURCE_TABLE` type makes it an onchain table
ResourceId tableId = ResourceIdLib.encode({
  typeId: RESOURCE_TABLE,
  name: "Balance"
});

// Using the `RESOURCE_OFFCHAIN_TABLE` type makes it an offchain table
ResourceId offchainTableId = ResourceIdLib.encode({
  typeId: RESOURCE_OFFCHAIN_TABLE,
  name: "Balance"
});
```

### Key schema

The key schema represents the data types of the (composite) key of the table.
Internally the composite key is always handled as `bytes32[]`, but the key schema allows [offchain indexers](../services/indexer) to create properly typed composite key columns, and allows MUD to generate [typed table libraries](./table-libraries).

The key schema can contain up to 28 static (fixed length) data types.
Note that no dynamic (variable length) data types (e.g. arrays, `bytes` or `string`) are supported in the key schema.

```solidity copy
import { Schema, SchemaLib } from "@latticexyz/store/src/Schema.sol";
import { SchemaType } from "@latticexyz/schema-type/src/solidity/SchemaType.sol";

// NOTE: the key schema can only include static types
SchemaType[] memory keySchemaTypes = new SchemaType[](1);
keySchemaTypes[0] = SchemaType.ADDRESS;
Schema keySchema = SchemaLib.encode(keySchemaTypes);
```

### Value schema

The value schema represents the data types of the value fields of the table.
Similar to key schemas, it allows [offchain indexers](../services/indexer) to create properly typed value columns, and allows MUD to generate [typed table libraries](./table-libraries).

The value schema can contain up to 28 fields in total, of which up to 5 can be dynamic (variable length) data types (e.g. arrays, `bytes`, `string`).
All static (fixed length) data types must come before the dynamic data types.

```solidity copy
import { Schema, SchemaLib } from "@latticexyz/store/src/Schema.sol";
import { SchemaType } from "@latticexyz/schema-type/src/solidity/SchemaType.sol";

// NOTE: static types must come before dynamic types
SchemaType[] memory valueSchemaTypes = new SchemaType[](1);
valueSchemaTypes[0] = SchemaType.UINT256;
Schema valueSchema = SchemaLib.encode(valueSchemaTypes);
```

### Key and field names

Key and (value) field names are simple string arrays, and must have the same length as the key and value schemas respectively.

```solidity copy
string[] memory keyNames = new string[](1);
keyNames[0] = "owner";


string[] memory fieldNames = new string[](1);
fieldNames[0] = "balance";
```

### Field layout

The field layout encodes the byte length of each static data type in the table.
This is mostly a way to save gas in onchain operations that require the length of static fields, as it avoids additional steps to translate the schema into the corresponding byte length.

```solidity copy
import { FieldLayout, FieldLayoutLib } from "@latticexyz/store/src/FieldLayout.sol";

uint256[] memory staticFields = new uint256[](1);
staticFields[0] = 32; // The byte length of the first field
FieldLayout fieldLayout = FieldLayoutLib.encode({
  staticFields: staticFields,
  numDynamicFields: 0
});
```

### Manually register a table

Registering a table is a prerequisite for writing to the table, and allows [offchain indexers](../services/indexer) to replicate the onchain state.

```solidity
import { IStore } from "@latticexyz/store/src/IStore.sol";

IStore store = IStore(STORE_ADDRESS);
store.registerTable({
  tableId: tableId,
  fieldLayout: fieldLayout,
  keySchema: keySchema,
  valueSchema: valueSchema,
  keyNames: keyNames,
  fieldNames: fieldNames
});
```
