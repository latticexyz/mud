Each piece of data in `Store` is stored as a _record_ in a _table_.
You can think of tables in two ways, either as a relational database or as a key-value store.

- Each table is identified by a unique `ResourceId tableId`.
- Each record in a table is identified by a unique `bytes32[] keyTuple`.
  You can think of the key tuple as a composite key in a relational database, or as a nested mapping in a key-value store.
- Each table has a `ValueSchema` that defines the types of data stored in the table.
  You can think of the value schema as the column types in a table in a relational database, or the type of structs stored in a key-value store.
