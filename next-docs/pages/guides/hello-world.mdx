# Hello World

On this page you learn how to modify a `World` before it is deployed to the blockchain.
If you want to learn how to modify a `World` that is already deployed, [see the extending world page](./extending-world).

The examples on this page use [the vanilla template](../template/typescript/vanilla).
[See this page for installation instructions](../template/typescript/getting-started).
Every example is written under the assumption that it is independent, and built on top of a new vanilla template.

- [Add a table](hello-world/add-table).
- [Add a system](hello-world/add-system).
- [Deploy to a blockchain](deploy).
