- Replace `blockEventsToStorage` with `blockLogsToStorage` that exposes a `storeOperations` callback to perform database writes from store operations. This helps encapsulates database adapters into a single wrapper/instance of `blockLogsToStorage` and allows for wrapping a block of store operations in a database transaction.
- Add `toBlock` option to `groupLogsByBlockNumber` and remove `blockHash` from results. This helps track the last block number for a given set of logs when used in the context of RxJS streams.
