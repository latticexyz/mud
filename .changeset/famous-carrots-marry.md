Replaced the `react` template with a basic task list app using the new Zustand storage adapter and sync method. This new template better demonstrates the different ways of getting and setting data in a MUD app with fewer concepts to learn (i.e. just tables and records).

For ECS-based React apps, you can use `react-ecs` template for the previous RECS storage adapter.
