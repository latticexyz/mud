Replaced the `react` template with a basic task list app using the new Zustand storage adapter and sync method. This new template better demonstrates the different ways of building with MUD and has fewer concepts to learn (i.e. just tables and records, no more ECS).

For ECS-based React apps, you can use `react-ecs` template for the previous RECS storage adapter.
