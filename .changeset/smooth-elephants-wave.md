Store sync logic is now consolidated into a `createStoreSync` function exported from `@latticexyz/store-sync`. This simplifies each storage sync strategy to just a simple wrapper around the storage adapter. You can now sync to RECS with `syncToRecs` or SQLite with `syncToSqlite` and PostgreSQL support coming soon.

There are no breaking changes if you were just using `syncToRecs` from `@latticexyz/store-sync` or running the `sqlite-indexer` binary from `@latticexyz/store-indexer`.
