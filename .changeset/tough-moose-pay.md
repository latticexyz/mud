- Added a `Result<Ok, Err>` type for more explicit and typesafe error handling ([inspired by Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/)).

- Added a `includes` util as typesafe alternative to [`Array.prototype.includes()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/includes).
