# Minimal MUD example project with multiple namespaces

This example project demonstrates how to use the MUD framework to create a simple on-chain application.

## Getting started

1. Since this project uses local MUD dependencies, you need to prepare them first by running this command in the MUD root directory: `pnpm install && pnpm build`
2. To start the development environment of this project, run `pnpm dev` in the project root. This will start a local chain and deploy the contracts in `packages/contracts`.
