    # pnpm no longer runs this before the actual install (https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/3760)
    # but we need to create some placeholder files like bins so that the install step can find them and put references to them in the right spot
    # this resolves some chicken-and-egg problems with using workspace bins before they're created (install -> build -> install)
