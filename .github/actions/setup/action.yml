      # We use `--child-concurrency=1` for now because our install step calls `prepare` on each package, which often does a `forge build` and forge has a hard time running these things in parallel (resulting in `Text file busy (os error 26)` errors in CI)
      run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --child-concurrency=1
