# Miscellaneous MUD integration tests

This project includes tests that can't or shouldn't be reduced to a test file in an existing project.

## Getting started

1. Since this project uses local MUD dependencies, you need to prepare them first by running this command in the MUD root directory: `pnpm install && pnpm build`
2. Run `pnpm test` in this project's root.
