![Interaction between the `World`, a `System`, and a table](./world-table.svg)

1. An account calls a function called `game__myFunc` on the `World`.
   [This function was registered](./function-selectors) by the owner of the `game` namespace and points to the `myFunc` function in one of the `System`s in the `namespace` namespace.

2. The `World` verifies that access is permitted (for example, because `game:System` is publicly accessible) and if so calls `myFunc` on the `game:System` contract with the provided parameters.

3. At some point in its execution `myFunc` decides to update the data in the table `game:Items`.
   As with all other tables, this table is stored in the `World`'s storage.
   To modify it, `function` calls a function on the `World` contract.

4. The `World` verifies that access is permitted (by default it would be, because `game:System` has access to the `game` namespace).
   If so, it modifies the data in the `game:Items` table.
