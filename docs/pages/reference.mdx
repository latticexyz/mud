# Reference

## Operations

### Create a new codebase

- Using the latest snapshot release:

  ```
  pnpm create mud@main <directory>
  ```

- Using the latest pre-release:

  ```
  pnpm create mud@next <directory>
  ```

  ### Modify the codebase version

- Switch to the latest snapshot release:

  ```
  pnpm mud set-version --tag main && pnpm install
  ```

- Switch to the latest pre-release:

  ```
  pnpm mud set-version --tag next && pnpm install
  ```

- Switch to [a specific commit](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commits/main):

  ```
  pnpm mud set-version --commit <hash> && pnpm install
  ```

## Debugging

### Onchain components

#### Foundry debugging

The MUD onchain components typically use the [Foundry development stack](https://book.getfoundry.sh/), meaning any of Foundry's debugging tools are available.
Use this prodecure to view the output from [`anvil`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/anvil/):

1. Add `console.log` to your systems, edit their Solidity files.

   - Import console.log.

     ```solidity
     import { console } from "forge-std/console.sol";
     ```

   - Add `console.log` statements inside your Solidity functions.

     ```solidity
     console.log("newValue:", newValue);
     ```

1. Run `anvil` manually.

   ```sh
   anvil -b 1 --base-fee 0 | uniq | tee anvil.log
   ```

   Note that due to a bug, there might be multiple copies of the same `console.log` message.
   Piping through [`uniq`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/uniq.1.html) helps reduce this issue.

   You do not have to use `tee anvil.log`, but `anvil` logs so much that it is often useful to be able to look for information in the log file after it has scrolled off the screen.

1. Edit `packages/contracts/package.json` to change the `scripts.dev` definition.

   ```
   "dev": "pnpm mud dev-contracts --rpc http://127.0.0.1:8545",
   ```

   Use `127.0.0.1`, there is a weird bug that makes it a problem to use `localhost` is some circumstances.

1. Run `pnpm dev` normally.

#### MUD dev tools

You can also see what is happening from your application by enabling to MUD dev tools.
To do so, add this code to the client side of your application:

```javascript
import { mount as mountDevTools } from "@latticexyz/dev-tools";
// https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html
if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
  const { mount: mountDevTools } = await import("@latticexyz/dev-tools");
  mountDevTools({
    config: mudConfig,
    publicClient: network.publicClient,
    walletClient: network.walletClient,
    latestBlock$: network.latestBlock$,
    blockStorageOperations$: network.blockStorageOperations$,
    worldAddress: network.worldContract.address,
    worldAbi: network.worldContract.abi,
    write$: network.write$,
    recsWorld: network.world,
  });
}
```

In the minimal application you get from `pnpm create mud@<version> <app>`, the MUD dev tools are already included.

### Server components

At present there is only one MUD server component, [the Indexer](/indexer).
To produce debug outputs, specify the environment variable `DEBUG` before you start the indexer.

| Information about                         | `DEBUG` value       |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Synchronization with the onchain database | `mud:store-sync:*`  |
| Requests for information from clients     | `mud:store-indexer` |
| Everything                                | `mud:*`             |
