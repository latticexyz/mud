# The MUD Indexer

The MUD Indexer is an off-chain indexer for on-chain applications built with MUD.

## Why an off-chain indexer?

Reads with on-chain apps can be tricky.
What does it mean to be able to query the Ethereum network?
Technically, given a node with a fully synced state, we can explore just about everything using the EVM, but the “exploring” would be looking at raw storage slots for accounts corresponding to smart contracts.
A way around this exists by providing view functions on smart contracts: these effectively are just wrappers around raw storage and expose a more friendly API.
Instead of having to figure out where the balances for an account are stored in the storage tree, we now can call a function that does the lookup via Solidity via an RPC endpoint.

The issue with view functions is that complexity in having to generate and call these to get the “full picture” of the state from the chain explodes pretty quickly.
For a web app client wanting to present the user with an up-to-date view of the on-chain state, the task of calling the different view functions becomes unnecessarily hard very fast.
This can also quickly accelerate the need to run a set of dedicated nodes just to be able to service the needed number of RPC requests.

## Installation

These are the steps to install and start the MUD indexer.
They are written under the assumption you are using `anvil` for your test chain, which is what the getting started package's `pnpm dev` does.

1. Build the repository [as explained here](contribute#local-development-setup).

1. Ensure you have [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installed.

1. Run a test world.
   The easiest way to do this is to follow [these directions](tutorials/minimal#getting-the-initial-version) in a separate command line window.

1. Start the indexer.

   ```sh
   cd packages/store-indexer
   pnpm start:local
   ```

1. Run this command as a sanity check to verify the indexer is working correctly:

   ```sh
   curl 'http://localhost:3001/findAll?batch=1&input=%7B%220%22%3A%7B%22json%22%3A%7B%22chainId%22%3A31337%2C%22address%22%3A%220x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3%22%7D%7D%7D' | jq
   ```

   The result should be nicely formatted (and long) JSON output.

## Data access and interpretation

### Using the indexer with TypeScript

### Using HTTP

<WarningBox
  title="URLs and parameters may vary"
  message={
    <>
      <p>
        The parameters, especially the URL, may change as we adjust our [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) configuration.

        If you can use the TypeScript methods, those are more stable.
      </p>
    </>

}
/>

The indexer is built on top of [tRPC](https://trpc.io/), which is primarily designed to be used between [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) programs.
As a result, the data format is more complicated than REST APIs.

For queries, the indexer expects to get two parameters in a [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string):

- `batch`, the batch identifier.
  This parameter can contain any string, as long as it is present.

- `input`, the actual query.
  This query is a [URLEncoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#URL_encoding) [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) object.
  To play with possible object values, you can use [this online calculator](https://www.urlencoder.org/).

  For example, the input object used in the sanity check above is:

  ```json
  {
    "0": {
      "json": {
        "chainId": 31337,
        "address": "0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  An HTTP request can include multiple queries, so the query object includes a numbered key (or numbered keys) with the actual queries.
  Also, in the future other formats than JSON might be supported, so each query specifies what format it uses.

The one type of query currently supported is `findAll`. It gives you all the information stored on the specific world in the indexer.
The query is available at path `/findAll` and have two parameters:

- `chainId`: The chain ID of the blockchain to query.
- `address`: The address of the `World`.
  Based on the paramters in the development environment, `pnpm dev` uses the address in the sanity check.

To understand the result, it is easiest to look at it inside Node.

1. Read the result and enter `node`:

   ```sh
   curl 'http://localhost:3001/findAll?batch=wd&input=%7B%220%22%3A%7B%22json%22%3A%7B%22chainId%22%3A31337%2C%22address%22%3A%220x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3%22%7D%7D%7D' > res.json
   node
   ```

1. Read the result into a JavaScript object.

   ```javascript
   res = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("res.json"));
   ```

1. `res` is actually a list of results, which only has one item because we only had one key in the query.
   This item has one key, `record`, whose value also has only one key, `data`.
   Run these commands to verify the statements above and then cut `res` to the actual result.

   ```javascript
   res.length;
   Object.keys(res[0]);
   Object.keys(res[0].result);
   res = res[0].result.data;
   ```

1. Inside the result there are two fields:

   - `meta`, the [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata).
     In the case of JSON the field names are part of the data, so this primarily contains data types.
   - `json`, the data read from the `World`.
     This field itself is divided into two values:
     - `blockNumber`, the block number in which these query results apply.
     - `tables`, a list of the tables in the `World` and their data.

   You can use [the `filter` function](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_filter.asp) to get a specific table.
   In this case, we are getting the `Counter` table.

   ```javascript
   counterTable = res.json.tables.filter((t) => t.name === "Counter")[0];
   ```

1. Finally, to get the actual record with the counter value, use:

   ```javascript
   counterTable.records[0].value.value;
   ```
