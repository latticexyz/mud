# Indexer

Indexer is an off-chain indexer for on-chain applications build with MUD.

## Why an off-chain indexer?

**Coming soon**

## Installation

These are the steps to install and start Indexer.
They are written under the assumption you are using `anvil` for your test chain, which is what the getting started package's `pnpm dev` does.

1. Ensure you have these applications installed:

   - [`curl`](https://curl.se/)
   - [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)
   - [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en)
   - [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/)

1. Download the source code for MUD.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/latticexyz/mud.git
   cd mud
   ```

1. Remove the `services` package.
   This package includes various services which are not required for building any of the other packages in the repository.

   ```sh
   rm -rf packages/services
   ```

1. Install and build packages.
   It is necessary to build the entire repository, not just the `store-index` package.

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   pnpm build
   ```

1. Run a test world.
   The easiest way to do this is to follow [these directions](tutorials/minimal#getting-the-initial-version) in a separate command line window.

1. Start the indexer.

   ```sh
   cd packages/store-indexer
   pnpm start:local
   ```

1. Run this command as a sanity check to verify Indexer is working correctly:

   ```sh
   curl 'http://localhost:3001/findAll?batch=1&input=%7B%220%22%3A%7B%22json%22%3A%7B%22chainId%22%3A31337%2C%22address%22%3A%220x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3%22%7D%7D%7D' | jq
   ```

   The result should be nicely formatted (and long) JSON output.

## Data access and interpretation

### Using HTTP

The Indexer is built on top of [tRPC](https://trpc.io/), which is primarily designed to be used between [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) programs.
As a result, the data format is a bit more complicated than REST APIs.

For queries, the Indexer expects to get two parameters in a [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string):

- `batch`, the batch identifier.
  This parameter can contain any string, as long as it is present.

- `input`, the actual query.
  This query is a [URLEncoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#URL_encoding) [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) object.
  To play with possible object values, you can use [this online calculator](https://www.urlencoder.org/).

  For example, the input object used in the sanity check above is:

  ```json
  {
    "0": {
      "json": {
        "chainId": 31337,
        "address": "0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  An HTTP request can include multiple queries, so the query object includes a numbered key (or numbered keys) with the actual queries.
  Also, in the future other formats than JSON might be supported, so each query specifies what format it uses.

#### findAll queries

These queries find all the information stored on a specific world in Indexer.
They are available at path `/findAll` and have two parameters:

- `chainId`: The chain ID of the blockchain to query.
- `address`: The address of the `World`.
  Based on the paramters in the development environment, `pnpm dev` uses the address in the sanity check.

To understand the result, it is easiest to look at it inside Node.

1. Read the result and enter `node`:

   ```sh
   curl 'http://localhost:3001/findAll?batch=wd&input=%7B%220%22%3A%7B%22json%22%3A%7B%22chainId%22%3A31337%2C%22address%22%3A%220x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3%22%7D%7D%7D' > res.json
   node
   ```

1. Read the result into a JavaScript object.

   ```javascript
   res = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("res.json"));
   ```

1. `res` is actually a list of results, which only has one item because we only had one key in the query.
   This item has one key, `record`, whose value also has only one key, `data`.
   Run these commands to verify the statements above and then cut `res` to the actual result.

   ```javascript
   res.length;
   Object.keys(res[0]);
   Object.keys(res[0].result);
   res = res[0].result.data;
   ```

1. Inside the result there are two fields:

   - `meta`, the [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata).
     In the case of JSON the field names are part of the data, so this primarily contains data types.
   - `json`, the data read from the `World`.
     This field itself is divided into two values:
     - `blockNumber`, the block number in which these query results apply.
     - `tables`, a list of the tables in the `World` and their data.

   You can use [the `filter` function](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_filter.asp) to get a specific table.
   In this case, we are getting the `Counter` table.

   ```javascript
   counterTable = res.json.tables.filter((t) => t.name === "Counter")[0];
   ```

1. Finally, to get the actual record with the counter value, use:

   ```javascript
   counterTable.records[0].value.value;
   ```
