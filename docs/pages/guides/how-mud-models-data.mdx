# How MUD models data

The MUD framework helps you to model your onchain state in a way that enables building applications with familiar tooling, like relational databases.

In your MUD config, you define data as a set of tables. Like relational databases, these tables have “columns” by way of two MUD concepts: a key schema and a value schema. Each one has a set of fields that map to Solidity types.

## Defining tables

Let's say we're making a game where players can move around a map. The definition for a `Position` table might look something like:

<CollapseCode>

```tsx filename="mud.config.ts" {3-11} showLineNumbers
export default mudConfig({
  tables: {
    Position: {
      keySchema: {
        player: "address",
      },
      valueSchema: {
        x: "int32",
        y: "int32",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

</CollapseCode>

Translating the table definition above would look like this in a relational database:

<MUDTable>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>player</th>
      <th>x</th>
      <th>y</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0x1234</th>
      <td>-5</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>0x5678</th>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</MUDTable>

Because `player` in part of the key schema, we would have a unique/primary key constraint on `player`.

Let's add another table for terrain at a given position on the map. MUD allows for multiple keys in the key schema and, like databases, we call these composite keys.

<CollapseCode>

```tsx filename="mud.config.ts" {12-20} showLineNumbers
export default mudConfig({
  tables: {
    Position: {
      keySchema: {
        player: "address",
      },
      valueSchema: {
        x: "int32",
        y: "int32",
      },
    },
    Terrain: {
      keySchema: {
        x: "int32",
        y: "int32",
      },
      valueSchema: {
        terrainType: "string",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

</CollapseCode>

Similarly, the relational database representation of that table would look like:

<MUDTable>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>x</th>
      <th>y</th>
      <th>terrainType</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>-1</th>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>grass</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>tree</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>grass</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</MUDTable>

Because we have a composite key of `x` and `y`, we would have a unique/primary key constraint on the tuple of `(x, y)` .

## Tables on chain

Solidity and the EVM have much more limited data structures, so how can we express a relational database onchain? MUD takes the concept of tables and does a few things with them:

- encodes each table record as a key/value pair before storing onchain
- emits an event for each mutation
- provides a typed Solidity library to abstract this away

## Field types

Key schema fields can use all of Solidity's static-length primitive types like `uint256`, `address`, `bool`.

Value schema fields can use all of Solidity's static-length primitive types, arrays of those static-length primitive types, as well as and `string` and `bytes`.

Enums and user types are also supported and automatically map down to their Solidity primitive types.

More complex types like structs, `string[]`, and `bytes[]` are not yet supported. We'll cover the reasons why in our encoding/decoding guide.
