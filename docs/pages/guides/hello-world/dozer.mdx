# Add dozer hydration

In this tutorial you learn how to add dozer hydration to an existing MUD application, such as the ones created by the template.
To avoid running dozer locally, we use a `World` on Garnet at address [`0x95F5d049B014114E2fEeB5d8d994358Ce4FFd06e`](https://explorer.garnetchain.com/address/0x95F5d049B014114E2fEeB5d8d994358Ce4FFd06e) that runs a slightly modified version of [the React template](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/tree/main/templates/react).
You can see the data schema for the `World` [in the block explorer](https://explorer.garnetchain.com/address/0x95F5d049B014114E2fEeB5d8d994358Ce4FFd06e?tab=mud).

## Create a client to access the `World`

These are the steps to create a client that can access the `World`.

1. Create and run a react template application.

   ```sh copy
   pnpm create mud@latest tasks --template react
   cd tasks
   pnpm dev
   ```

1. [Browse to the application](http://localhost:3000/?chainId=17069&worldAddress=0x95f5d049b014114e2feeb5d8d994358ce4ffd06e).
   The URL specifies the `chainId` and `worldAddress` for the `World`.

1. In MUD DevTools see your account address and [fund it on Garnet](https://garnetchain.com/faucet).
   You may need to get test ETH for your own address, and then transfer it to the account address the application uses.

1. You can now create, complete, and delete tasks.

1. To see the content of the `app__Creator` table, edit `packages/contracts/mud.config.ts` to add the `Creator` table definition.

   <CollapseCode>

   ```typescript filename="mud.config.ts" copy showLineNumbers {15-21}
   import { defineWorld } from "@latticexyz/world";

   export default defineWorld({
     namespace: "app",
     tables: {
       Tasks: {
         schema: {
           id: "bytes32",
           createdAt: "uint256",
           completedAt: "uint256",
           description: "string",
         },
         key: ["id"],
       },
       Creator: {
         schema: {
           id: "bytes32",
           taskCreator: "address",
         },
         key: ["id"],
       },
     },
   });
   ```

### Updating the client to use dozer

The main purpose of dozer is to allow MUD clients to specify the subset of table records that a client needs, instead of synchronizing whole tables.

To update the client, you change `packages/client/src/mud/setupNetwork.ts` to:

<CollapseCode>

```typescript filename="setupNetwork.ts" copy showLineNumbers {17, 80-97, 106-107}

<summary>Explanation</summary>

```typescript
import { DozerSyncFilter, getSnapshot, selectFrom } from "@latticexyz/store-sync/dozer";
```

Import the dozer definitions we need.

```typescript
const dozerUrl = "https://dozer.mud.garnetchain.com/q";
```

The URL for the dozer service.
This is simplified testing code, on a production system this will probably be a lookup table based on the chainId.

```typescript
const yesterday = Date.now() / 1000 - 24 * 60 * 60;
```

In JavaScript (and therefore TypeScript), time is stored as milliseconds since [the beginning of the epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).
In UNIX, and therefore in Ethereum, time is stored as seconds since that same point.
This is the timestamp 24 hours ago.

```typescript
  const filters: DozerSyncFilter[] = [
```

We create the dozer filter for the tables we're interested in.
This is the _dozer_ filter, so it is only used for the initial hydration of the client.

```typescript
    selectFrom({
      table: mudConfig.tables.app__Tasks,
      where: `"createdAt" > ${yesterday}`,
    }),
```

From the `app__Tasks` table we only want entries created in the last 24 hours.
To verify that the filter works as expected you can later change the code to only look for entries older than 24 hours.

```typescript
    { table: mudConfig.tables.app__Creator },
  ];
```

We also want the entire `app__Counter` table.

```typescript
const { initialBlockLogs } = await getSnapshot({
  dozerUrl,
  storeAddress: networkConfig.worldAddress as Hex,
  filters,
  chainId: networkConfig.chainId,
});
```

Get the initial snapshot to hydrate (fill with initial information) the data store.
Note that this snapshot does not have the actual data, but the events that created it.

```typescript
const liveSyncFilters = filters.map((filter) => ({
  tableId: filter.table.tableId,
}));
```

The live synchronization filters are used after the initial hydration, and keep up with changes on the blockchain.
These synchronization filters are a lot more limited, [you can read the description of these filters here](/guides/hello-world/filter-sync#filtering).

```typescript
  const { ... } = await syncToZustand({
    initialBlockLogs,
    filters: liveSyncFilters,
      ...
  });
```

Finally, we provide `initialBlockLogs` for the hydration and `filters` for the updates to the synchronization function (either `syncToRecs` or `syncToZustand`).
