# Filter data synchronization

In this tutorial you modify `networkSetup.ts` to filter the information you synchronize.
Filtering information this way allows you to reduce the use of network resources and makes loading times faster.

## Setup

To see the effects of filtering we need a table with entries to filter. To get such a table:

1. [Create a new MUD application from the `vanilla` template](/quickstart).
1. [Run the guide to add a table](./add-table).

## Filtering

Edit `packages/client/src/mud/setupNetwork.ts`.

- Import [`pad`](https://viem.sh/docs/utilities/pad.html) from viem.
- Import [`resourceToHex`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/common/src/resourceToHex.ts) to create resource identifiers.
- Add a `filters` field to the `syncToRecs` call.

Click **Increment** a few times to see you only see the history for counter values 1 and 5.
You can also go to the MUD Dev Tools and see that when you select **Components > History** it only has those lines.

### Explanation

The `filters` field contains a list of filters.
Only rows that match at least one line are synchronized.
Each filter is a structure that can have up to three fields, and all the fields that are specified must match a row for the filter to match.

- `tableId`, the table ID to synchronize.
  You create this value using [`resourceToHex`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/common/src/resourceToHex.ts), the type can be either `table`, or `offchainTable`.
- `key0`, the first key value (as a 32 byte hexadecimal string).
- `key1`, the second key value (as a 32 byte hexadecimal string).

<details>

<summary>The filters in the code sample</summary>

```ts
    filters: [
      {
         tableId: resourceToHex({ type: "table", namespace: "", name: "Counter"}),
      },
```

The first filter is for the `:Counter` table (`Counter` in the root namespace).
We don't specify any keys, because we want all the rows of the table.
It's a singleton so there is only one row anyway.

```ts
      {
         tableId: resourceToHex({ type: "table", namespace: "", name: "History"}),
         key0: pad("0x01"),
      },
      {
         tableId: resourceToHex({ type: "table", namespace: "", name: "History"}),
         key0: pad("0x05"),
      },
    ],
```

These two filters apply to the `History` table.
This table has just one key, the counter value which the row documents.
We need a separate filter for every value, and here we have two we care about: `1` and `5`.

## Limitations

There are several limitations on filters.

- We can only filter on these fields:
  - The table ID (`tableId`)
  - The first key (`key0`)
  - The second key (`key1`)
- We can only filter by checking for equality.
  We cannot check ranges, or get all values except for a specific one (inequality).

Of course, once we have the data we can filter it any way we want.
The purpose of these filters is to restrict the information we get at all, either directly from the blockchain or from the indexer.
