# Filter data synchronization

In this tutorial you modify `networkSetup.ts` to filter the information you synchronize.
Filtering information this way allows you to reduce the use of network resources and makes loading times faster.

## Setup

To see the effects of filtering we need a table with entries to filter. To get such a table:

1. [Create a new MUD application from the `vanilla` template](../../templates/typescript/getting-started).
1. [Run the guide to add a table](./add-table).
