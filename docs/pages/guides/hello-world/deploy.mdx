# Deploy to a blockchain

In this tutorial you deploy a MUD application to our test blockchain, [Garnet](https://garnetchain.com/bridge)

## Setup

[Create a new MUD application from the template](/quickstart).
Use the `vanilla` template.

```sh copy
pnpm create mud@latest tutorial --template vanilla
cd tutorial
pnpm dev
```

## Deployment

1. Change to the `contracts` package.

   ```sh copy
   cd packages/contracts
   ```

1. See that `foundry.toml` has a `[profile.garnet]` section with the RPC URL.

1. Connect to [the Garnet faucet](https://garnetchain.com/faucet) to obtain test ETH.

1. Specify the private key for the address that got the test ETH on Garnet.

   ```sh copy
   export PRIVATE_KEY=0x <your private key goes here>
   ```

1. Deploy using the [`mud deploy`](/cli/deploy) command.

   ```sh copy
   pnpm mud deploy --profile garnet
   ```

1. After the deployment is over, look at the `World` information.
   The key, `17069`, is the chain ID for Garnet.

   ```sh copy
   cat worlds.json | jq .\"17069\"
   ```

1. To go to your application, [specify the chain ID on the URL](http://localhost:3000/?chainid=17069).
   You can also quit out of the `pnpm dev` and specify the chain ID when running vite.

   ```sh copy
   cd packages/client
   export VITE_CHAIN_ID=17069
   pnpm vite
   ```

   When you do that, it is no longer necessary to specify the chain ID on the URL.
   [The default URL](http://localhost:3000) takes you directly to the onchain application.
