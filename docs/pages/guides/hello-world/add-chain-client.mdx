# Add chains to the client

In this tutorial you modify a template application to use a public blockchain instead of [`anvil`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/).
Note that this is not required if you are going to use Lattice chains, [redstone](https://redstone.xyz/) and [garnet](https://garnetchain.com/)

## Setup

[Create a new MUD application from the template](../../templates/typescript/getting-started).
Use the vanilla template.

```sh copy
pnpm create mud@latest tutorial --template vanilla
cd tutorial
```

You can also use the `react-ecs` or `threejs` templates without any changes to the tutorial.
If you wish to use the `react` template you'll need to modify a bit to account for the use of Zustand instead of RECs.

## File changes

You need to edit `supportedChains.ts`, and possibly also `setupNetwork.ts`.

- Edit the file `packages/client/src/mud/supportedChains.ts` to add the chain definition from Viem.
  You can see [the list of chains supported by Viem](https://github.com/wevm/viem/blob/main/src/chains/index.ts).
  If you need a different chain you can use [`defineChain`](https://viem.sh/docs/chains/introduction#custom-chains).

  ```ts filename="supportedChains.ts" copy showLineNumbers {2,4}
  import { MUDChain, mudFoundry, redstone, garnet } from "@latticexyz/common/chains";
  import { holesky } from "viem/chains";

  export const supportedChains: MUDChain[] = [mudFoundry, redstone, garnet, holesky];
  ```

- If the chain object in Viem doesn't have a webSocket endpoint, only an HTTP one, you need to edit [`packages/client/src/mud/setupNetwork.ts`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/templates/vanilla/packages/client/src/mud/setupNetwork.ts#L47) to only use a webSocket endpoint when one is defined.
  You might also wish to deal with the possibility you only have a webSocket endpoint defined, depending on the chains you support.

## Use the application

When you run the client, set two parameters:

- `chainId`, the chain ID. You can set this information in the URL, or in the vite environment as `VITE_CHAIN_ID`.
- `initialBlockNumber`, the block number where the `World` contract was first deployed.
  Without this value, the client will try to synchronize from the beginning of the blockchain, which could take a long time.
  You can set this value either in the URL, or the `worlds.json` file (as `blockNumber`).

For example, to connect to the Holesky `World` at address [`0x78900cc99939b24a95b2892961ad0c701df97993`](https://eth-holesky.blockscout.com/address/0x78900cc99939b24a95b2892961ad0c701df97993?tab=contract_code), which contains [the standard contract code](/templates/typescript/contracts), you use this URL:

```url
http://localhost:3000/?chainid=17000
```

And this file in `packages/contracts/worlds.json`:

```json
{
  "31337": {
    "address": "0x8d8b6b8414e1e3dcfd4168561b9be6bd3bf6ec4b"
  },
  "17000": {
    "address": "0x78900cc99939b24a95b2892961ad0c701df97993",
    "blockNumber": 1844083
  }
}
```
