# Getting started

## Prerequisites

- git ([download](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
- foundry (forge, anvil, cast) ([download](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation), make sure to `foundryup` at least once)
- node.js (v17+) ([download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
- pnpm (`npm install pnpm --global` after installing node)

## Setup

Most projects in MUD are started by running `pnpm create mud <project name>`, but for this tutorial we've included some initial code to get you up and running quicker. This includes React components and base TailwindCSS styles.

1. Fork or clone from the [Emojimon starter kit repo](https://github.com/latticexyz/emojimon).
   You can use the command below.

   ```bash copy
   git clone https://github.com/latticexyz/emojimon.git -b mud-update-next-14
   ```

1. Install the dependencies and start up the MUD services (anvil node, contracts deployer, and client).

   ```bash copy
   cd emojimon && pnpm install && pnpm run dev
   ```

1. At this point you can play the game to see the finished game.
   Open the game in your browser.
   By default the game is at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), but it could be on a different port if that port's taken.

1. Click the map to spawn at a specific location and move using the arrow keys.
   Note that on each block you can only move one space, and the block time on the anvil blockchain is one second.

1. Now that you've seen our end goal, reset the repository to [the starting snapshot](https://github.com/latticexyz/emojimon/tree/8520a8206929f6265609cc9166c985846fd0cd87).

```sh copy
git reset --hard 8520a8206929f6265609cc9166c985846fd0cd87
```

After you do this, the game is just a green area where the map is going to be.

<summary>Code structure</summary>

Except for a few utility files, most of the code is in two packages:

- [`packages/contracts`](https://github.com/latticexyz/emojimon/tree/main/packages/contracts) contains the onchain part of the game.
- [`packages/client`](https://github.com/latticexyz/emojimon/tree/main/packages/client) contains the offchain part of the game, the user interface.
  The software runs on the user's browser, it is just served from a [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) server.
