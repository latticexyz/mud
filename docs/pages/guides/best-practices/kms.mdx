# Deploy production worlds using AWS KMS

The MUD equivalent of [root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser) is the owner of the root namespace, by default this is the address that deployed the `World`.
Because this address is so powerful, its private key needs to be very secure.
We recommend as best practice to use [AWS Key Management Service](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) as the deployer for `World`s in production.

## Sign up with AWS

1. If you do not already have an AWS account, [create one](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start/email).
   The free tier is sufficient for this purpose.

1. Sign in as a **Root user**.

## Create an IAM user and an access key with permission to use the key to sign

1. In the AWS console click **Services** in the top-left corner and then **Security, Identity, & Compliance > IAM**.

1. Click **Access management > Users** and then click **Create user**.

1. Create a user called `Appname_world_owner`.
   Do not give it any permission for now.

1. Click the user name and select the **Security credentials** tab.

1. Scroll down and click **Create access key**.
   Select **Command Line Interface (CLI)** and click the confirmation.
   For the description tag value write `Appname_world_owner_access`.

1. Click **Show** to see the access key and keep the access key and secret access key in a safe place.

## Create an Ethereum public/private key pair

You can read additional details about this process [in the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html).

1. In the AWS console click **Services** in the top-left corner and then **Security, Identity, & Compliance > Key Management Service**.

1. Click **Create a key** and select **Customer managed key**.
   Select these parameters:

   | Parameter          | Value                                 |
   | ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
   | Key type           | Asymmetric                            |
   | Key usage          | Sign and verify                       |
   | Key spec           | ECC_SECG_OP256K1                      |
   | Alias              | Appname_world_owner_address           |
   | Key administrators | None                                  |
   | Key deletion       | Clear (only root can delete this key) |
   | Key users          | **Appname_world_owner**               |

1. Write down the key ID.

## Install and configure the AWS CLI

1. Install the AWS CLI [from the website](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

1. Set the AWS environment variables.

   | Variable              | Value                                                                                                                              |
   | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID     | The access key you created                                                                                                         |
   | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | The secret access key                                                                                                              |
   | AWS_REGION            | AWS region (the first component of the console's domain name, such as `us-east-2`)                                                 |
   | AWS_ENDPOINT_URL      | `https://` followed by [the hostname from the AWS console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/kms.html) for your region |
   | AWS_KMS_KEY_ID        | The key ID for the world owner address, such as `6e8dcfb6-24fe-4fb0-a9ce-afb560f8ce7b`                                             |

## Use the new key

1. Get the key's deployment address and fund it.
   For example, if you already have your private key in `$PRIVATE_KEY` you can use this command to send 1 ETH to the new address on Holesky.

   ```sh copy
   AWS_ADDRESS=`cast wallet address --aws`
   export ETH_RPC_URL=https://ethereum-holesky-rpc.publicnode.com
   cast send $AWS_ADDRESS --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --value 1ether
   ```

1. Update scripts as needed.
   Scripts cannot rely on reading the deployment key from the local environment when you use KMS.
   Instead, use `vm.startBroadcast()` without any parameters to get the signature using whatever mechanism is used with `forge`, such as KMS.

1. To deploy a new `World`, run this command.

   ```sh copy
   pnpm mud deploy --kms
   ```

1. If you need to run forge scripts, use this command.

   ```sh
   forge script --aws
   ```

   Forge will automatically detect the AWS configuration from the environment variables.
