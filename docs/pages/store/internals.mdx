## Internal tables of Store

`StoreCore.initialize` creates all the internal tables.
It is called within `StoreRead`'s constructor (which is implemented by `World`).

### Tables

- `Tables` - maps table ID to the table's key schema, value schema, key names, and field names.
- `Hooks` - maps table ID to an array of table hooks
