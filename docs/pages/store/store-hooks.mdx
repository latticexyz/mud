# Store hooks

Store hooks allow you to react to state changes onchain.

There are many ways to [interact with tables](./reference/store-core), but they all boil down to four types of state changes:

1. A full record (static and dynamic length data) is set (`SetRecord`)
2. A part of the static length data of a record is changed (`SpliceStaticData`)
3. A part of the dynamic length data of a record is changed (`SpliceDynamicData`)
4. A full record is deleted (`DeleteRecord`)

By registering a store hook contract on a table, arbitrary logic can be triggered `before` or `after` each of these state changes.

### Store hook contract

A store hook contract is a contract that implements the [`IStoreHook`](./reference/store-hook) interface.

After the store hook contract [is registered](#register-a-hook), `Store` calls the enabled hook methods on each state change.

Example: a hook that creates a lookup table of existing values in a table

```solidity copy
import { StoreHook } from "@latticexyz/store/src/StoreHook.sol";
import { Exists } from "./codegen/tables/Exists.sol";

contract CustomHook is StoreHook {
  function onBeforeSetRecord(
    ResourceId tableId,
    bytes32[] memory keyTuple,
    bytes memory staticData,
    PackedCounter encodedLengths,
    bytes memory dynamicData,
    FieldLayout
  ) public override {
    Exists.set(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(staticData, encodedLengths, dynamicData)), true);
  }
}
```

### Hook registration

Hooks are registered via the [`StoreCore`](./reference/store-core) library or [`IStore`](./reference/store) interface.
It is possible to select the type of state change that should trigger a hook and the time (before or after) with a bitmap passed during the registration.

<CollapseCode>
```solidity filename="@latticexyz/store/src/storeHookTypes.sol" {2} copy showLineNumbers
/// @dev Flag to enable the `onBeforeSetRecord` hook.
uint8 constant BEFORE_SET_RECORD = 1 << 0;

/// @dev Flag to enable the `afterSetRecord` hook.
uint8 constant AFTER_SET_RECORD = 1 << 1;

/// @dev Flag to enable the `beforeSpliceStaticData` hook.
uint8 constant BEFORE_SPLICE_STATIC_DATA = 1 << 2;

/// @dev Flag to enable the `afterSpliceStaticData` hook.
uint8 constant AFTER_SPLICE_STATIC_DATA = 1 << 3;

/// @dev Flag to enable the `beforeSpliceDynamicData` hook.
uint8 constant BEFORE_SPLICE_DYNAMIC_DATA = 1 << 4;

/// @dev Flag to enable the `afterSpliceDynamicData` hook.
uint8 constant AFTER_SPLICE_DYNAMIC_DATA = 1 << 5;

/// @dev Flag to enable the `beforeDeleteRecord` hook.
uint8 constant BEFORE_DELETE_RECORD = 1 << 6;

/// @dev Flag to enable the `afterDeleteRecord` hook.
uint8 constant AFTER_DELETE_RECORD = 1 << 7;

</CollapseCode>

Example: registering a custom store hook that is triggered before a record is set and before a record is deleted

```solidity

import { StoreCore } from "@latticexyz/store/src/StoreCore.sol";
import { Resourceid } from "@latticexyz/store/src/ResourceId.sol";
import {
  BEFORE_SET_RECORD,
  AFTER_DELETE_RECORD
} from "@latticexyz/store/src/storeHookTypes.sol";

ResourceId TABLE_ID = ... // table ID to watch for state changes

StoreCore.registerStoreHook({
  tableId: TABLE_ID,
  hookAddress: address(new CustomHook()),
  enabledHooksBitmap: BEFORE_SET_RECORD | AFTER_SET_RECORD
});
````
