## Store Config & `tablegen` Tool

<Aside emoji="⚠️">
  Currently, `tablegen` is only compatible with Foundry, and MUD 2 uses Foundry for testing and building. Hardhat will
  be available in the future.
</Aside>

The `tablegen` CLI tool generates libraries for Store tables. It makes it much less error-prone than using the Store low-level API, and comes with typed Solidity APIs when setting and retrieving records.

### Using `tablegen` with the MUD framework

If you are using the MUD framework and have a `mud.config.ts` file in your project, you can edit your Store config directly in this file!
Keep reading from the "Adding Tables" section

### Using `tablegen` without the MUD framework

<Aside emoji="⚠️">
  We are making this process easier, and will not require a MUD config in the future in order to use `tablegen`
</Aside>

A Store config should be named `mud.config.ts`, and placed at the root of your project (if you are building a mono-repo, put it at the root folder of where your contracts will be, in the same folder as your Foundry config).

This is the minimal config:

```tsx
import { mudConfig } from "@latticexyz/store/register";

export default mudConfig({
  tables: {}, // an empty config with no tables
});
```

### Generating the tables

To generate the tables, run `pnpm mud tablegen` in the same folder as the config file.

### Adding Tables

Adding a table is done by creating an entry in the `table` object of the config.

```tsx
import { mudConfig } from "@latticexyz/store/register";

export default mudConfig({
  tables: {
    MyTable: {
      valueSchema: {
        value: "uint32",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

The key of the entry is the name of the table, and the value is another object: the table configuration.

The table configuration can have these properties:

**`directory` (optional)**: a `string`: which directory to create the table in. the default is `tables` (in the source directory as defined by the Foundry config; in MUD the default in `src`, so the default table directory is `src/tables`)

**`fileSelector` (optional)** _only used with the World framework_: a `string`: where to create the table in the namespace.

**`tableIdArgument` (optional)**: `bool`: whether to create getter and setter functions with the table ID as an argument, this is used to generate a single library to operate on multiple tables with the same key and value structure.

**`storeArgument` (optional)**: `bool`: whether to create getter and setter functions with the store address as an argument, this is used to generate a single library to operate on the same table in multiple stores. This adds new functions to the library, doubling the amount of functions created (each getter/setter will comes in a pair of “with `storeArgument`” and “without `storeArgument`”)

**`dataStruct` (optional)**: `bool`: whether to create getter and setter functions with a data struct.

_For 1-column tables it’s `false` by default. For multi-column tables it’s `true` by default._

Example of a table library with `dataStruct`:

```tsx
// no data struct
MyTable.set(keccak256("some.key"), 1, 12, "foo");
// data struct
MyTable.set(keccak256("some.key"), { field1: 1, field2: 12, stringField: "foo" });
```

**`keySchema` (optional):** an object with keys being the key name, and value being types of the keys. By default, the table will have a single key of type `bytes32`.

Example:

```tsx
tables: {
  MyTableWithTwoKeys: {
    valueSchema: {
      value1: "uint32",
      value2: "uint32",
    },
    keySchema: {
      key1: "uint256",
      key2: "string",
    },
  },
}
```

**`valueSchema` (required)**: an object with keys being the column name, and value being types from `SchemaType`

Example:

```tsx
tables: {
  MyTableWithFourValues: {
    valueSchema: {
      x: "uint32",
      y: "uint32",
      stringField: "string",
      uintArray: "uint256",
    },
  },
}
```

### Shortcut: table with a single column

There is a shortcut to create a table with a `uint256` key and a single column in the value schema:

```tsx
tables: {
  // Create a table with key uint256 and a single column with type address
  CounterTable: "address";
}
```

### Singleton tables

In order to create Singleton tables that do not have keys (and effectively store a single value), you must pass an empty object to the `keySchema` property

Example:

```tsx
tables: {
  MySingletonTable: {
    valueSchema: {
      value1: "uint32",
      value2: "uint32",
    },
    keySchema: {},
  },
}
```

The getter and setter functions will not have a `key` argument.

### User types

`tablegen` supports Solidity enums as keys and values. They must be defined in your config as `enums` in the `userTypes` property of the config:

```tsx
import { mudConfig } from "@latticexyz/store/register";

export default mudConfig({
  tables: {},
  enums: {
    AnimalType: ["NONE", "DOG", "CAT", "SQUIREL"],
  },
});
```

You can then use the name of your enum as a string in place of a type from `SchemaType`

Example:

```tsx
tables: {
  // Create a table with key uint256 and a single column with type AnimalType
  AnimalTypeTable: "AnimalType";
}
```
