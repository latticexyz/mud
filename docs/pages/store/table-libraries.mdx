# Table Libraries

Methods on [`StoreCore`](../references/store-core) and [`IStore`](../references/store) use raw bytes as input and output types.
This is to allow using the same methods for different types of tables types without native support for generics in Solidity, but it can be inconvenient to work with.
For this reason MUD automatically generates a library for each table that provides typed methods corresponding to the table's key and value types.

## Config

Table libraries are generated by the [`tablegen`](../cli/tablegen) CLI.
The [CLI config](/cli/config) section goes into more detail on the available configuration options.

To illustrate table library functionality on this page, we'll use two example tables with the following configurations:

```ts filename="Position"
schema: {
  entity: "address",

  // Two static length fields
  x: "uint32",
  y: "uint32",
},
key: ["entity"],
```

```ts filename="Inventory"
schema: {
  entity: "address",

  // One dynamic length field
  slots: "uint8[]",
},
key: ["entity"],
```

### Singleton tables

When you just need to store a single value (for example, the world map or the name of an in-game currency), you use a singleton table, a table whose key schema is empty.
With an empty key schema there is just one record.

```ts filename="Counter"
schema: {
  value: "uint32",
},
key: [],
```

## Usage

### Importing the library

By default table libraries are generated into a `codegen/tables` directory in the contract directory.
This can be configured with the `codegenDirectory` option in the [config](/cli/config).
The library name corresponds to the table's key in the table config.

```solidity
import { Position } from "./codegen/tables/Position.sol";
import { Inventory } from "./codegen/tables/Inventory.sol";
```

For convenience, the [`tablegen`](../cli/tablegen) CLI also generates an `index.sol` file that re-exports all the generated table libraries.

```solidity
import { Position, Inventory } from "./codegen/tables/index.sol";
```

### Registering the table

Before using the table library, it must be registered once in the Store.
This happens automatically as part of the [deploy CLI](/cli/deploy), but if you're using the table library in a [Module](/world/modules) or a contract that's not deployed by MUD, you'll need to register it manually.

```solidity
Position.register();
Inventory.register();
```

The table library will detect the `Store` context automatically (via [`StoreSwitch`](#storeswitch)).

### Reading data

Table libraries provide typed methods for reading data from the `Store`.

#### Read full record

To read the entire record, use the `get` method.
If the table's value schema contains more than one field, the method returns a struct with the corresponding fields.

```solidity copy
import { Position, PositionData } from "./codegen/tables/Position.sol";

address entity = address(0x1234);
PositionData memory position = Position.get(entity);
```

#### Read individual fields

To read a single field, use the `get` method with the field name as a suffix.

```solidity copy
import { Position } from "./codegen/tables/Position.sol";

address entity = address(0x1234);
uint32 x = Position.getX(entity);
```

#### Read length of dynamic length field

To read the length of a dynamic length field, use the `length` method with the field name as a suffix.

```solidity copy
import { Inventory } from "./codegen/tables/Inventory.sol";

address entity = address(0x1234);
uint256 length = Inventory.lengthSlots(entity);
```

#### Read individual elements of dynamic length field

To read individual fields of a dynamic length field, use the `getItem` method with the field name as a suffix and the index as an argument.

```solidity copy
import { Inventory } from "./codegen/tables/Inventory.sol";

address entity = address(0x1234);
uint8 item = Inventory.getItemSlots(entity, 0);
```

### Writing data

Table libraries provide typed methods for writing data to the `Store`.

#### Write full record

To write the entire record, use the `set` method.
There is a variant of this method that accepts a struct, and a variant that accepts the individual fields.

```solidity copy
import { Position, PositionData } from "./codegen/tables/Position.sol";

address entity = address(0x1234);

// set with individual fields
Position.set(entity, 1, 2);

// or set with struct
Position.set(entity, PositionData(1,2));
```

#### Write individual fields

To write a single field, use the `set` method with the field name as a suffix.

```solidity copy
import { Position } from "./codegen/tables/Position.sol";

address entity = address(0x1234);
Position.setX(entity, 1);
```

#### Write individual elements of dynamic length field

To write individual fields of a dynamic length field, use the `update` method with the field name as a suffix and the index as an argument.

```solidity copy
import { Inventory } from "./codegen/tables/Inventory.sol";

address entity = address(0x1234);
Inventory.updateSlots(entity, 0, 1);
```

#### Push to dynamic length field

To push a new element to a dynamic length field, use the `push` method with the field name as a suffix.

```solidity copy
import { Inventory } from "./codegen/tables/Inventory.sol";

address entity = address(0x1234);
Inventory.pushSlots(entity, 1);
```

#### Pop from dynamic length field

To remove the last element from a dynamic length field, use the `pop` method with the field name as a suffix.

```solidity copy
import { Inventory } from "./codegen/tables/Inventory.sol";

address entity = address(0x1234);
Inventory.popSlots(entity);
```

Note that this method does not return the popped element.
If you need to access the popped element, use the `getItem` method before calling `pop`.

```solidity copy
import { Inventory } from "./codegen/tables/Inventory.sol";

address entity = address(0x1234);
uint256 length = Inventory.lengthSlots(entity);
uint8 lastItem = Inventory.getItemSlots(entity,  length - 1);
Inventory.popSlots(entity);
```

## Advanced

### StoreSwitch

Table libraries internally use the `StoreSwitch` library to write data to the Store.
`StoreSwitch` detects whether the library is called from within a `Store` contract or from an external contract that has a reference to the `Store` contract.

1. If the library is called from within a `Store` contract, `StoreSwitch` accesses the store directly via the [internal `StoreCore` library](./reference/store-core).
2. If the library is called from a contract that has a fixed reference to a specific external `Store` contract, `StoreSwitch` accesses this `Store` via the [external `IStore` interface](./reference/store).
3. If `msg.sender` is a `Store` contract, `StoreSwitch` accesses the `Store` via the caller's address via the [external `IStore` interface](./reference/store).

To fix a reference to a specific `Store` contract (2), use the `StoreSwitch.setStoreAddress` method in your contract.

```solidity copy
import { StoreSwitch } from "@latticexyz/store/src/StoreSwitch.sol";

StoreSwitch.setStoreAddress(STORE_ADDRESS);
```

This can be useful to test libraries using table libraries in isolation, by setting the `Store` address in the test contract to a mock `Store` contract.
This happens automatically in the [`MudTest`](/cli/test) setup.
