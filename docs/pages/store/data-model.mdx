# How MUD models data

The MUD framework helps you to model your onchain state in a way that enables building applications with familiar tooling, like relational databases.

In your MUD config, you define data as a set of tables. Like relational databases, these tables have “columns” by way of two MUD concepts: a schema and a key. A schema is set of fields that map to Solidity types and a key is the list of fields that combine to form the table's primary key.

## Defining tables

Let's say we're making a game where players can move around a map. The definition for a `Position` table might look something like:

<CollapseCode>

```tsx filename="mud.config.ts" {5-12} showLineNumbers
import { defineWorld } from "@latticexyz/world";

export default defineWorld({
  tables: {
    Position: {
      schema: {
        player: "address",
        x: "int32",
        y: "int32",
      },
      key: ["player"],
    },
  },
});
```

</CollapseCode>

Translating the table definition above would look like this in a relational database:

<MUDTable>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>player</th>
      <th>x</th>
      <th>y</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0x1234</th>
      <td>-5</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>0x5678</th>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</MUDTable>

Because `player` is the key, we would have a unique/primary key constraint on `player`.

Let's add another table for terrain at a given position on the map. MUD allows for multiple fields in the key and, like databases, we call these composite keys.

<CollapseCode>

```tsx filename="mud.config.ts" {13-20} showLineNumbers
import { defineWorld } from "@latticexyz/world";

export default defineWorld({
  tables: {
    Position: {
      schema: {
        player: "address",
        x: "int32",
        y: "int32",
      },
      key: ["player"],
    },
    Terrain: {
      schema: {
        x: "int32",
        y: "int32",
        terrainType: "string",
      },
      key: ["x", "y"],
    },
  },
});
```

</CollapseCode>

Similarly, the relational database representation of that table would look like:

<MUDTable>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>x</th>
      <th>y</th>
      <th>terrainType</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>-1</th>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>grass</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>tree</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>grass</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</MUDTable>

Because we have a composite key of `x` and `y`, we would have a unique/primary key constraint on the tuple of `(x, y)`.

## Tables on chain

Solidity and the EVM have much more limited data structures, so how can we express a relational database onchain? MUD takes the concept of tables and does a few things with them:

- [encodes each table record as a key/value pair](./encoding) before storing onchain
- [emits an event for each mutation](/guides/replicating-onchain-state)
- [provides a typed Solidity libraries](./table-libraries) to abstract this away

## Field types

Schema fields can use all of Solidity's static-length primitive types, arrays of those static-length primitive types, as well as `string` and `bytes`.

Key can only be used with fields that are defined as static-length Solidity primitive types.

Enums and user types are also supported and automatically map down to their Solidity primitive types.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ⓘ">
  The code and the rest of the documentation call some fields *static* and others *dynamic*. In MUD terminology *static*
  means *static length* (`uint16`, `int32`, `bytes32`, etc.) and *dynamic* means *dynamic length* (`uint[]`, `string`,
  `bytes`, etc.).
</Callout>

More complex types like structs, `string[]`, and `bytes[]` are not yet supported. We'll cover the reasons why in our encoding/decoding guide.
