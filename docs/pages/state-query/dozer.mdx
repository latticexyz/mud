# Dozer

If there is a dozer instance serving a blockchain, as there is for [Redstone](https://redstone.xyz/) and [Garnet](https://garnetchain.com/docs/what-is-redstone), you can use it to run queries on the data of any `World` on that blockchain.

The query language is a subset of [the SQL `SELECT` command](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_(SQL)>).

## Example `World`

On Garnet there is a `World` at address [`0x95F5d049B014114E2fEeB5d8d994358Ce4FFd06e`](https://explorer.garnetchain.com/address/0x95F5d049B014114E2fEeB5d8d994358Ce4FFd06e) that runs a slightly modified version of [the React template](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/tree/main/templates/react).
You can see the data schema for the `World` [in the block explorer](https://explorer.garnetchain.com/address/0x95F5d049B014114E2fEeB5d8d994358Ce4FFd06e?tab=mud).

### Create a client to access the `World`

These are the steps to create a client that can access the `World`.
You do not need these steps to run `curl` queries, but you do need this client to see how to [modify a client to support dozer](#using-dozer-from-a-mud-client).

1. Create and run a react template application.

   ```sh copy
   pnpm create mud@latest tasks --template react
   cd tasks
   pnpm dev
   ```

1. [Browse to the application](http://localhost:3000/?chainId=17069&worldAddress=0x95f5d049b014114e2feeb5d8d994358ce4ffd06e).
   The URL specifies the `chainId` and `worldAddress` for the `World`.

1. In Mud DevTools see your account address and [fund it on Garnet](https://garnetchain.com/faucet).
   You may need to get test ETH for your own address, and then transfer it to the account address the application uses.

1. You can now create, complete, and delete tasks.

1. To see the content of the `app__Creator` table, edit `packages/contracts/mud.config.ts` to add the `Creator` table definition.

   <CollapseCode>

   ```typescript filename="mud.config.ts" copy showLineNumbers {15-21}
   import { defineWorld } from "@latticexyz/world";

   export default defineWorld({
     namespace: "app",
     tables: {
       Tasks: {
         schema: {
           id: "bytes32",
           createdAt: "uint256",
           completedAt: "uint256",
           description: "string",
         },
         key: ["id"],
       },
       Creator: {
         schema: {
           id: "bytes32",
           taskCreator: "address",
         },
         key: ["id"],
       },
     },
   });
   ```

   </CollapseCode>

The Garnet dozer instance is at `https://dozer.mud.garnetchain.com`.

## cUrl queries

You can run dozer queries by communicating directly with the server's API.

### Simple query

This query looks for some fields from a single table.

1. Create a file, `query.json`, with this content.

   ```json filename="query.json" copy
   [
     {
       "address": "0x95F5d049B014114E2fEeB5d8d994358Ce4FFd06e",
       "query": "SELECT id, description FROM app__Tasks"
     }
   ]
   ```

   <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">

   Dozer does not support `SELECT * FROM <table>`, you have to specify column names.

   </Callout>

1. Run this command. Install `curl` and `jq` first if necessary.

   ```sh copy
   curl https://dozer.mud.garnetchain.com/q --compressed \
        -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip'  \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d @query.json | jq
   ```

The output is a mapping with two fields, the block height for which the result is valid, and the result itself.
The result is a list of query responses, here it contains just one item because we only submitted a single query.
The query response is also a list.
The first entry is the field names, and all the other entries are rows returned by `SELECT`.

```
{
  "block_height": 5699682,
  "result": [
    [
      [
        "id",
        "description"
      ],
      [
        "0x3100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
        "Walk the dog"
      ],
      [
        "0x3e0a112aadc5e02927fb4a91649bea565fd1baa1175aae4cb4957d6348f165cf",
        "Test"
      ],
    ]
  ]
}
```

Here we only care about the first result, so from now on we use this command line to tell `jq` to only show us that information.

```sh copy
curl https://dozer.mud.garnetchain.com/q --compressed  \
    -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d @query.json | jq '.result[0]'
```

### Conditions

If we want to see only those tasks that haven't been completed we can use a `WHERE` clause.

```json filename="query.json" copy
[
  {
    "address": "0x95F5d049B014114E2fEeB5d8d994358Ce4FFd06e",
    "query": "SELECT id, description FROM app__Tasks WHERE completedAt=0"
  }
]
```

<details>

<summary>Results</summary>

```json
[
  ["id", "description"],
  ["0x3100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "Walk the dog"],
  ["0x3e0a112aadc5e02927fb4a91649bea565fd1baa1175aae4cb4957d6348f165cf", "Test"]
]
```

</details>

### Limited results

If you only want to see a few results, you can use a `LIMIT` clause.

```json filename="query.json" copy
[
  {
    "address": "0x95F5d049B014114E2fEeB5d8d994358Ce4FFd06e",
    "query": "SELECT id, description FROM app__Tasks LIMIT 2"
  }
]
```

<details>

<summary>Results</summary>

```json
[
  ["id", "description"],
  ["0x3100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "Walk the dog"],
  ["0x3e0a112aadc5e02927fb4a91649bea565fd1baa1175aae4cb4957d6348f165cf", "Test"]
]
```

</details>

You can use `OFFSET` to get a paging effect.
For example, if you use this `query.json` you get two results, and the last row of the first one is repeated as the first row of the second one.

```json filename="query.json" copy
[
  {
    "address": "0x95F5d049B014114E2fEeB5d8d994358Ce4FFd06e",
    "query": "SELECT id, description FROM app__Tasks LIMIT 3"
  },
  {
    "address": "0x95F5d049B014114E2fEeB5d8d994358Ce4FFd06e",
    "query": "SELECT id, description FROM app__Tasks LIMIT 3 OFFSET 2"
  }
]
```

<details>

<summary>Results</summary>

Use this command to see the results of both queries.

```sh copy
curl https://dozer.mud.garnetchain.com/q --compressed  \
  -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @query.json \
  | jq '.result'
```

The result is:

```json
[
  [
    ["id", "description"],
    ["0x3100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "Walk the dog"],
    ["0x3e0a112aadc5e02927fb4a91649bea565fd1baa1175aae4cb4957d6348f165cf", "Test"],
    ["0xb15fd0e41ab0bb6eb992e0a3d4f30fce6ee24a5fc9c30f725fdfc96d9d16ed95", "Do the dishes"]
  ],
  [
    ["id", "description"],
    ["0xb15fd0e41ab0bb6eb992e0a3d4f30fce6ee24a5fc9c30f725fdfc96d9d16ed95", "Do the dishes"],
    ["0xb81d5036d0b62e0f2536635cbd5d7cec1d1f0706c0c6c1a9fa74293d7b0888eb", "Take out the trash"]
  ]
]
```

</details>

### Sorted results

If you want to control the order in which you get results, you can use an `ORDER BY` clause.

```json filename="query.json" copy
[
  {
    "address": "0x95F5d049B014114E2fEeB5d8d994358Ce4FFd06e",
    "query": "SELECT description, createdAt FROM app__Tasks ORDER BY createdAt"
  }
]
```

Note that the sort field(s) need to be part of the selected columns.

<details>

<summary>Results</summary>

```json
[
  ["description", "createdat"],
  ["Walk the dog", "1723495628"],
  ["Take out the trash", "1723495640"],
  ["Do the dishes", "1723495642"],
  ["Test", "1723495964"],
  ["Test from a different account", "1723576522"],
  ["Another test", "1723576522"],
  ["Yet another test", "1723646440"]
]
```

</details>

### Multiple tables

You can join multiple tables, using the same syntax SQL uses.

```json filename="query.json" copy
[
  {
    "address": "0x95F5d049B014114E2fEeB5d8d994358Ce4FFd06e",
    "query": "SELECT app__Creator.id, description, taskCreator FROM app__Tasks, app__Creator WHERE app__Creator.id=app__Tasks.id"
  }
]
```

<details>

<summary>Results</summary>

```json
[
  ["id", "description", "taskcreator"],
  [
    "0x3e0a112aadc5e02927fb4a91649bea565fd1baa1175aae4cb4957d6348f165cf",
    "Test",
    "0x735b2f2c662ebedffa94027a7196f0559f7f18a4"
  ],
  [
    "0x727d7bfe00b6db638c69595059dc10e21c52a7912d090905a7c7dc8659efd3b8",
    "Test from a different account",
    "0x428b1853e5ec29d35c84a218ec5170efc7621b58"
  ],
  [
    "0xb15fd0e41ab0bb6eb992e0a3d4f30fce6ee24a5fc9c30f725fdfc96d9d16ed95",
    "Do the dishes",
    "0x8225d72f2c39f3729d7f3fc03c6aa8731eaeef48"
  ],
  [
    "0xb81d5036d0b62e0f2536635cbd5d7cec1d1f0706c0c6c1a9fa74293d7b0888eb",
    "Take out the trash",
    "0x8225d72f2c39f3729d7f3fc03c6aa8731eaeef48"
  ],
  [
    "0xd43394ecf79077f65cd83b534dd44d3b4e9e2aa553e95aafecd14b8529543cda",
    "Another test",
    "0x428b1853e5ec29d35c84a218ec5170efc7621b58"
  ]
]
```

</details>

### Grouping results

You can use `GROUP BY` to identify different groups.
For example, this query gets you the different task creators.

```json filename="query.json" copy
[
  {
    "address": "0x95F5d049B014114E2fEeB5d8d994358Ce4FFd06e",
    "query": "SELECT taskCreator FROM app__Creator GROUP BY taskCreator"
  }
]
```

<details>

<summary>Results</summary>

```json
[
  ["taskcreator"],
  ["0x428b1853e5ec29d35c84a218ec5170efc7621b58"],
  ["0x735b2f2c662ebedffa94027a7196f0559f7f18a4"],
  ["0x8225d72f2c39f3729d7f3fc03c6aa8731eaeef48"]
]
```

## Using dozer from a MUD client

The main purpose of dozer is to allow MUD clients to specify the subset of table records that a client needs, instead of synchronizing whole tables.

To update the client, you change `packages/client/src/mud/setupNetwork.ts` to:

<summary>Explanation</summary>

```typescript
import { DozerSyncFilter, getSnapshot, selectFrom } from "@latticexyz/store-sync/dozer";
```

Import the dozer definitions we need.

```typescript
const dozerUrl = "https://dozer.mud.garnetchain.com/q";
```

The URL for the dozer service.
This is simplified testing code, on a production system this will probably be a lookup table based on the chainId.

```typescript
const yesterday = Date.now() / 1000 - 24 * 60 * 60;
```

In JavaScript (and therefore TypeScript), time is stored as milliseconds since [the beginning of the epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).
In UNIX, and therefore in Ethereum, time is stored as seconds since that same point.
This is the timestamp 24 hours ago.

```typescript
  const filters: DozerSyncFilter[] = [
```

We create the filters for the tables we're interested in.

```typescript
    selectFrom({
      table: mudConfig.tables.app__Tasks,
      where: `"createdAt" > ${yesterday}`,
    }),
```

From the `app__Tasks` table we only want entries created in the last 24 hours.
To verify that the filter works as expected you can later change the code to only look for entries older than 24 hours.

```typescript
    { table: mudConfig.tables.app__Creator },
  ];
```

We also want the `app__Counter` table.

```typescript
const { initialBlockLogs } = await getSnapshot({
  dozerUrl,
  storeAddress: networkConfig.worldAddress as Hex,
  filters,
  chainId: networkConfig.chainId,
});
```

Get the initial snapshot to hydrate (fill with initial information) the data store.
Note that this snapshot does not have the actual data, but the events that created it.

```typescript
const liveSyncFilters = filters.map((filter) => ({
  tableId: filter.table.tableId,
}));
```

The synchronization filters are a lot more limited.
[You can read the description of these filters here](/guides/hello-world/filter-sync#filtering).

```typescript
  const { ... } = await syncToZustand({
    initialBlockLogs,
    filters: liveSyncFilters,
      ...
  });
```

Finally, we provide `initialBlockLogs` for the hydration and `filters` for the updates to the synchronization function (either `syncToRecs` or `syncToZustand`).
