# Quickstart

The easiest way to get started with MUD is to use [a template](/templates/typescript/getting-started).

1. Ensure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager#macos) 18+, [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) 8+ and [foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) installed.
1. Create a new app from a template:

   ```sh copy
   pnpm create mud@next my-project
   ```

1. Start the app:

   ```sh copy
   cd my-project
   pnpm dev
   ```

1. Browse to the application.
   Usually it is at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), but if that port is in use it might be 3001, 3002, etc.
