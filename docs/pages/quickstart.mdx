# Quickstart

The easiest way to get started with MUD is to use [a template](/templates/typescript/getting-started).

1. Ensure you have `node` and `pnpm` installed.
1. Create and start the application:

   ```sh copy
   pnpm create mud@next my-project && cd my-project && pnpm dev
   ```

1. Select the template to use.
1. Browse to the application.
   Usually it is at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), but if that port is in use it might be 3001, 3002, etc.
