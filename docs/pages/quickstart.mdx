# Getting started

In most cases the easiest way to get started is to use
[the TypeScript templates](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/tree/main/templates) provided by [Lattice](https://lattice.xyz/).

## Prerequisites

To install the TypeScript templates you need:

- [Node.js v18](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).
  Note that version 18 is _required_.
  We do not support older or newer versions at the moment.

           ```sh copy

           export PATH=$PATH:~/.foundry/bin

## Installation

To run any of the TypeScript templates:

1. Create the template with pnpm.
   If you need, replace `tutorial` with your application name.

   ```sh copy
   pnpm create mud tutorial
   ```

   <details>

   <summary>Possible errors in this stage</summary>

   - `ERROR  No package.json (or package.yaml, or package.json5) was found in "/home/qbzzt1"`

     `pnpm` version too old.
     Run `sudo npm install -g pnpm` to update to the latest.

   - `ENOENT  ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir`

     Out of disk space.

   - `foundryup: need 'git' (command not found)`

     Install [`git`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

   - `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '?'`

     `pnpm` version too old.
     Run `sudo npm install -g pnpm` to update to the latest.

   - `tutorial is not empty directory.`

     The tutorial needs to be installed in an empty directory.
     Either delete the directory and its content (`rm -rf tutorial`) or use a different directory.

   </details>

1. Select the template:

   - [Vanilla](./templates/typescript/vanilla)
   - [React-ECS](./templates/typescript/react-ecs)
   - React
   - Phaser
   - [Three.js](./templates/typescript/threejs)

1. Start the development server, which updates automatically when you modify files.

   ```sh copy
   cd tutorial
   pnpm dev
   ```

   You can use the arrow keys to move between the logs for the `contracts` package and the logs for the `client` package.

   You can press **Q** to quit `pnpm dev`.
   If that doesn't work, press **Ctrl-A** and then **Q**.

   <details>

   <summary>Possible errors in this stage</summary>

   - `error binding to 127.0.0.1:8545: error creating server listener: Address already in use`

     [Foundry's `anvil`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/) is already running, possibly inside a different `pnpm dev`.

     On Linux you can use `sudo netstat -anpe | grep 8545 | grep LISTEN` to get the anvil process ID.
     You can stop the `anvil` process listening on port 8545 using this command.

     ```sh copy
     kill `sudo netstat -anpe | grep 8545 | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $9}' | sed 's/\/anvil//'`
     ```

     Alternatively, a different Ethereum client such as [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/) or [Reth](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth/intro.html) might be running.
     As those can be production clients, it is best not to develop on a machine that runs them.

   - `[vite] Internal server error: Failed to resolve import "contracts/out/IWorld.sol/IWorld.abi.json" from "src/mud/setupNetwork.ts"`

     Ignore it.
     It simply means the `contracts` package hasn't created the `IWorld.abi.json` file, which the `client` package needs, yet.
     As soon as it is created, the `client` package will use it.

   - `Waiting for localhost:8545......`

     This error happens when `anvil` isn't up yet.
     If it persists, check the `contracts` package.

   <Callout type="info" emoji="ⓘ">

   If nothing else works, the problem may be with [`mprocs`](https://github.com/pvolok/mprocs).
   We can bypass `mprocs` by running two separate command line windows.

   1. In the first command line window run these commands to start the client:

      ```sh copy
      cd packages/client
      pnpm dev
      ```

   1. In the second command line window run these commands to compile the contracts and start `anvil`:

      ```sh copy
      cd packages/contracts
      forge || export PATH=$PATH:~/.foundry/bin;
      pnpm dev
      ```

   </Callout>

   </details>

1. Browse to [`http://127.0.0.1:3000`](http://127.0.0.1:3000).
   If port 3000 is occupied then the front-end package, [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), will try to listen to port 3001, then 3002, etc.

## Using the templates

### Code organization

Other than a few utility files, most of the code is in two packages:

- `packages/contracts` contains the onchain part of the application.
- `packages/client` contains the offchain part of the application, the user interface.
  The app runs in the user's browser, in development it is served from a [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) server.
  The content of this package varies based on the template used.

### Vanilla and react-ecs

The applications in these two templates is the same.
You have an onchain counter and you can press `Increment` to increment it.

### Three.js

In this application the position of an object, the big green cube, is stored onchain.
In the user interface you can move that cube using the arrow keys, space, and ctrl.
