# Interacting with MUD from a client

MUD is client agnostic: any client -- a browser, a game engine, or an iOS app -- can implement the synchronization protocol and a client-side cache to replicate [Store](/store) tables, along with the necessary infrastructure to send transactions to the World.

However, currently we **only** officially support the browser and Node. We provide tooling for representing the onchain state and replicate it from an RPC or [MODE](/mode) via a network stack.

There also exists tooling for [Unity](https://github.com/emergenceland/unimud) from the folks at [emergence.land](https://emergence.land).

## Representing state in the browser

When using MUD in the browser, we provide two different ways to query the [Store](/Store) and react to changes:

1. **`recs`**: `recs` is a client-side store optimize for ECS modelling. If you [model your MUD data using ECS](/ecs), this is a great choice.
2. **`store-cache`**: `store-cache` is reactive tuple-database. It has a more powerful query system than `recs`, and support multiple keys. If don't use the ECS data model (eg: you have multi-key tables, like one-to-many relationship), we recommend using `store-cache`.

**Note**: when using the default MUD templates (created with `pnpm create mud@canary`), the Store data will be available in **both** client-side stores. You are free to query with the one that makes the most sense.

Over time, we will migrate to `store-cache` as the default and surface a opinionated layer for ECS data on top.

## `recs`: the reactive ECS database

`recs` has been designed to represent and query ECS data.
If your MUD tables are set up with a single `bytes32` key (see the [ECS modelling guide](/ecs)), and you plan to represent an entity and its associated components as the same `bytes32` key on multiple tables, then `recs` will let you query your data in a natural way.

To read data and react to changes with `recs`, there exists two APIs:

1. Reading component value directly
2. Subscribing to a query that returns a set of matching entities

For the examples below, let's assume this MUD config. Notice that each of these tables have an (implicit) `bytes32` key; which is recommended when [modelling your MUD data using ECS](/ecs).

```typescript
const config = mudConfig({
  tables: {
    NameComponent: "string",
    PlayerComponent: "bool",
    PositionComponent: { schema: { x: "int32", y: "int32" } },
  },
});
```

### Reading component value directly

If you have a specific `bytes32` key and a reference to a component, you can query its value directly, or use a React hook that will re-render when the corresponding component value updates.

**Reading component value in vanilla javascript**

```typescript
import { getComponentValueStrict } from "@latticexyz/recs";
// note: NameComponent is an recs component; components could come from the `setup` function of MUD.
const { NameComponent } = components
// get a reference to the recs world; as an example from the `setup` function of MUD.
const world = [...]
// you need a reference to an `Entity` from recs. For the sake of the example, let's say we know that the bytes32 key is "0xDEAD"
// you wouldn't do normally: entities would be found via queries.
const entityID = "0xDEAD" as EntityID;
const entity = world.registerEntity({ id: "0xDEAD" as EntityI })
// now we can fetch the value of the NameComponent on our entity
const name = getComponentValueStrict(NameComponent, entity)
// -> "John Doe"
```

**Reading component value in react with `@latticexyz/react`**

```tsx
import { useComponentValue } from "@latticexyz/react";
function ExampleComponent() {
  const { components, world } = useMUD;
  const { NameComponent } = components;
  // you need a reference to an `Entity` from recs. For the sake of the example, let's say we know that the bytes32 key is "0xDEAD"
  // you wouldn't do this normally: entities would be found via queries.
  const entityID = "0xDEAD" as EntityID;
  const entity = world.registerEntity({ id: "0xDEAD" });
  // now we can fetch the value of the NameComponent on our entity
  const name = useComponentValue(NameComponent, entity);
  // -> "John Doe"
  // this will re-render when the component value changes!
  return <p>{name ?? "<no name>"}</p>;
}
```

### Running queries

A common way of working with ECS data is by using queries.
A query is a function that returns a list of entities that match a set of predicates called _query fragments_.

There are 4 types of query fragments:

1. `Has`: matches entities that have a specific component.
2. `Not`: matches entities that do not have a specific component.
3. `HasValue`: matches entities that have a specific componenet with a set value.
4. `NotValue`: matches entities that do not have a component with a set value (will also match if it doesn't have the component at all)

**Running query with vanilla javsascript**

```typescript
import { runQuery, Has, HasValue, getComponentValueStrict } from "@latticexyz/recs";
const { PlayerComponent, PositionComponent, NameComponent } = components
// query for all named players at the center of the universe
const matchingEntities = runQuery([
  Has(PlayerComponent),
  Has(Name),
  HasValue(PositionCompoennt, {x: 0, y: 0})
])
// now you can map these to their name as an example
const names = matchingEntities.map(
  playerEntity => getComponentValueStrict(NameComponent, playerEntity
)
// -> ["Bob", "Alice", "Eve"]
```

**Reacting to queries with vanilla javascript**

```typescript
import { defineSystem, Has, HasValue, getComponentValueStrict, UpdateType } from "@latticexyz/recs";
const { PlayerComponent, PositionComponent, NameComponent } = components
// get a reference to the recs world; as an example from the `setup` function of MUD.
const world = [...]
defineSystem(world, [Has(PlayerComponent), Has(Name), HasValue(PositionComponent, {x: 0, y: 0}], ({entity, component, value, type}) => {
  // every time an entity enter, exit, or get updated within a query; this callback with fire
  // the "type" will match these: UpdateType.Enter, UpdateType.Exit, UpdateType.Update
  // as an example, if a new entity is named, has a player component, and is at the center of the universe; the callback fires
  // if the name of a player at the center of the universe changes, the callback will also fire for that entity
  // let's only log when a new entity matches this query
  // every time a named player reaches {0, 0}; we want to log their name
  if(type !== UpdateType.Enter) return
  console.log(getComponentValueStrict(NameComponent, entity) + " reached the center!")
})
```

**Reacting to queries with React and `@latticexyz/react`**

```tsx
import { useEntityQuery } from "@latticexyz/react";
import { Has, HasValue, getComponentValueStrict } from "@latticexyz/recs";
function ExampleComponent() {
  const { components, world } = useMUD;
  const { NameComponent, PlayerComponent, PositionCompoennt } = components
  // get a list of all entities that are named, players, and at the center of the universe
  // it is reactive and will trigger a re-render when the set of matching queries update
  const entities = useEntityQuery([Has(PlayerComponent), Has(Name), HasValue(PositionComponent, {x: 0, y: 0}])
  // [entity1, entity2, ...]
  return(
    <div>
      <span>Players at the center:</span>
      <ul>
      {entities.map(entity => (
        <li>{getComponentValueStrict(NameComponent, entity)}</li>
      ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## `store-cache`: a general tuple database

`store-cache` is a typed reactive database used to replicate the onchain Store of a MUD project into a Javacsript client (Node or Browser based).

Unlike `recs`, `store-cache` supports multiple keys. It also comes with a more powerful query system. Currently, ECS-like queries where the same primary key is assumed to be same entity (like what `recs` does) are quite verbose. We are working on making this better. Meanwhile, please make these queries with `recs`.

`store-cache` surfaces up three APIs:

1. Fetching a specific record from a table when the keys are known
2. Scanning a table with a query
3. Subscribing to a query

The `store-cache` package also exposes React hooks for each of these use-cases.

Let's assume this MUD config for the examples below. Notice that some tables have multiple keys in their
`keySchema`. We recommend using `store-cache` when querying these tables.

```typescript
const config = mudConfig({
  tables: {
    MultiKey: { keySchema: { first: "bytes32", second: "uint32" }, schema: { value: "uint256" } },
    AddressCounter: { keySchema: { owner: "address", counterId: "uint256" }, schema: { value: "int256" } },
    Position: { schema: { x: "int32", y: "int32" } },
  },
});
```

### Fetching a specific record

**Fetching a record in vanilla javascript**

```typescript
// This is typed!
const position = client.tables.Position.get({ key: "0x00" });
// -> { x: 1, y: 2}
const multiKey = client.tables.MultiKey.get({ first: "0xDEAD", second: 42 });
// -> { value: 38843n }
```

**Fetching a record with React and `@latticexyz/react`**

```tsx
import { useRow } from "@latticexyz/react";
function ExampleComponent() {
  const { storeCache } = useMUD;
  const position = useRow(client, { table: "Position", key: { key: "0x01" } });
  // -> { namespace: "", table: "Position", key: { key: "0x01" }, value: { x: 1, y: 2 } }
  const { value } = position;
  return (
    <div>
      <span>Player position</span>
      <span>
        x: {value.x}, y: {value.y}
      </span>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Scanning a table with a query

**Scanning a table in vanilla javascript**

```typescript
const rows = client.scan(); // get all rows in the store
// -> all rows in the store
const positions = client.tables.Position.scan(); // get all rows in the position table
// -> [{key: "0x00", value: {x: 10, y: 32}, namespace: config["namespace"], table: Position}, ...]
const positionsFiltered = client.tables.Position.scan({
  key: { gt: { key: "0x02" } },
}); // get all entries whose key is bigger than 0x02
// -> [{key: "0x03", value: {x: 69, y: 4}, namespace: config["namespace"], table: Position}, ...]
```

**Scanning a table with React and `@latticexyz/react`**

```tsx
import { useRows } from "@latticexyz/react";
function ExampleComponent() {
  const { storeCache } = useMUD;
  const positions = useRows(client, { table: "Position" });
  // -> [{key: "0x00", value: {x: 10, y: 32}, namespace: config["namespace"], table: Position}, ...]
  const positionsFiltered = useRows(client, { table: "Position", key: { gt: { key: "0x02" } } });
  //-> [{key: "0x03", value: {x: 69, y: 4}, namespace: config["namespace"], table: Position}, ...]
  return (
    <div>
      <span>Positions:</span>
      <ul>
        {positions.map(({ key, value }) => (
          <li>
            {key}: {value.x}, {value.y}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <span>Filtered Positions:</span>
      <ul>
        {positionsFiltered.map(({ key, value }) => (
          <li>
            {key}: {value.x}, {value.y}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Subscribe to queries

**Subscribing to queries in vanilla javascript**

```typescript
// subscribe to all changes of the Position table
client.tables.Position.subscribe(({ set, remove }) => {
  for (const entrySet of set) {
    // { key: "0x00" }, { x: 1, y: 2 }
    console.log(entrySet.key, entrySet.value);
  }
});
// subscribe to all changes of a single record with key 0x01
client.tables.Position.subscribe(
  ({ set, remove }) => {
    for (const entrySet of set) {
      // { key: "0x01" }, { x: 1, y: 2 }
      console.log(entrySet.key, entrySet.value);
    }
  },
  { key: { eq: { key: "0x01" } } }
);
```
