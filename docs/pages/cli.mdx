## The MUD CLI

The MUD CLI is used for building and developing a MUD project.

It comes with

1. `tablegen`: code-generation tool that makes it easy to work with Store tables
2. `create`: bootstrap a MUD project from one of the template.
3. `deploy`: deployer for MUD v2 projects that deploys an app using the [World](world) kernel onchain
4. `devnode`: a wrapper around Anvil with defaults needed to make MUD work properly in development. We recommend running `mud devnode` over `anvil`.
5. `faucet`: a interface to the Lattice Testnet faucet. It makes it easy to fund addresses on the testnet

## Installation

We donâ€™t recommend installing the CLI globally.

Instead, you should add the CLI as a dev dependency to your project (done automatically if you start from a starter kit using `yarn create mud`), and use it with `yarn mud` inside your project directory.

## Commands

## `tablegen`

Generates Store libraries from a `mud.config.mts` file. See the [Store Config and `tablegen` documentation](store/config) in the Store section for more details.

## `create`

Bootstrap a MUD project from a template. You can specify a template interactively when running the command without arguments, or pass it via `--template`

The valid templates are:

**`react`**: A MUD template with React client side that uses the MUD React hooks

**`minimal`**: A minimal template with javascript for the frontend (no framework)

## `deploy`

Deploy a MUD project with the World framework.

This tool will use the `mud.config.mts` to detect all systems, tables, modules, and namespaces in the World and will deploy them to the chain specified in your Foundry profile.

When using the deployer, you must set the private key of the deployer using the `PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable. You can make this easier by using `[dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)` before running `mud deploy` in your deployment script.

To set the profile used by the deployer, either set your `FOUNDRY_PROFILE` environment variable, or pass `--profile <profileName>` to the deployer (eg: `mud deploy --profile optimism-mainnet`).

The RPC used by the deployer will be `[http://localhost:8545](http://localhost:8545)` if no profile is set, otherwise it will be read from the `eth_rpc_url` configuration field of the Foundry profile.

Example profile:

```toml
# foundry.toml
[profile.lattice-testnet]
eth_rpc_url = "https://follower.testnet-chain.linfra.xyz"
[profile.optimism-mainnet]
eth_rpc_url = "https://infura[...]"
```

## `devnode`

Runs Anvil with a block time of 1s, and no base fee (to make it possible for unfunded account to send transactions).

This command also wipes the Anvil cache. Anvil cache blow-up problems wonâ€™t happen to you anymore ðŸ™‚

## `faucet`

Connects to a MUD faucet service to fund an address.

```bash
mud faucet --faucetUrl <faucetService> --adress <address>
```

The default faucet service is the one running on the Lattice testnet.

To fund an address on the testnet, run `mud faucet --address <address>`
