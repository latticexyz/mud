# Templates

MUD templates include client code as well as an onchain MUD `World`.
These integrations include data synchronization, which gives the client a read-only copy of the data in the [MUD tables](/store/tables).

## Official templates

We wrote a number of integrations between TypeScript and MUD.

- [Vanilla](/templates/typescript/vanilla)
- [React using RECS](/templates/typescript/react-ecs)
- React using Zustand
- [Three.js](/templates/typescript/threejs)

## Community templates

There are a number of other templates written by developers who wanted to use different frameworks with MUD.

**Disclaimer:** We appreciate the people who created these integrations, but as we did not verify them ourselves, we cannot guarantee their functionality or security.
