# Three.js

This template is for developers who use [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

You can start a new project using this template with:

```sh copy
pnpm create mud tutorial --template threejs
```

For more information, [see the quickstart guide](/quickstart).

## Onchain code

### `mud.config.ts`

[This file](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/templates/threejs/packages/contracts/mud.config.ts) contains the table definition.

```ts
import { mudConfig } from "@latticexyz/world/register";

export default mudConfig({
  tables: {
    Position: {
      valueSchema: {
        x: "int32",
        y: "int32",
        z: "int32",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

The table schema has one table, `Position`.
This table has no specified key schema, so MUD uses the default, a single `bytes32` field.
This allows us to tie table records to entities, which in MUD have a `bytes32` identifier.

### `MoveSystem.sol`

[This file](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/templates/threejs/packages/contracts/src/systems/MoveSystem.sol) is the system that is used to modify the data in MUD, which in this case is only `Position`.

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.8.21;
import { System } from "@latticexyz/world/src/System.sol";
```

The basic definition of what a `System` is.

```solidity
import { Position, PositionData } from "../codegen/index.sol";
```

Get the definitions related to the `Position` table, which are automatically generated from `mud.config.ts`.

```solidity
function distance(PositionData memory a, PositionData memory b) pure returns (int32) {
  int32 deltaX = a.x > b.x ? a.x - b.x : b.x - a.x;
  int32 deltaY = a.y > b.y ? a.y - b.y : b.y - a.y;
  int32 deltaZ = a.z > b.z ? a.z - b.z : b.z - a.z;

  return deltaX + deltaY + deltaZ;
}
```

A utility function to calculate [Manhattan Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry).
This is used to ensure that a player does not move more than one unit at a time (in any direction).

```solidity
contract MoveSystem is System {
  function move(int32 x, int32 y, int32 z) public {
```

This is the only function that `MoveSystem` exposes.
It lets a user move in the game universe.

```solidity
    bytes32 entityId = bytes32(uint256(uint160((_msgSender()))));
```

`_msgSender()` lets us know who called the `World` which received the call and then relayed it to the system.
The caller is an ethereum address, which is 20 bytes long.
To turn it into a `bytes32` value, which is the key we use in the `Position` table, we need to cast the address `uint160` (20 bytes are 160 bits), then to `uint256`, and finally to `bytes32`.

```solidity
    PositionData memory position = Position.get(entityId);
    PositionData memory newPosition = PositionData(x, y, z);
    require(distance(position, newPosition) == 1, "can only move to adjacent spaces");
```

Use the `PositionData` struct to calculate the distance between the old position and the new one.
If this distance is more than one unit, fail.

```
    Position.set(entityId, newPosition);
  }
}
```

Otherwise, update the position for `entityId`, which is the address that called the `World`, to the new position.

## Offchain code

The files you are likely to need to change in the offchain code are:

- [`packages/client/src/App.tsx`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/templates/threejs/packages/client/src/App.tsx), which controls the information displayed to the user.
  It is the place where you register handlers that are called when the value in a component (basically, a table) changes.
- [`packages/client/src/useKeyboardMovement.ts`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/templates/threejs/packages/client/src/useKeyboardMovement.ts), which receives keyboard events and dispatches them to calls to the onchain system.
- [`packages/client/src/mud/createSystemCalls.ts`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/templates/threejs/packages/client/src/mud/createSystemCalls.ts), which is where you write code that performs calls to an onchain system.

### `App.tsx`

The relevant definitions are in the [`Scene` React component](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/templates/threejs/packages/client/src/App.tsx#L28-L71):

```ts
const Scene = () => {
  const {
    components: { Position },
    network: { playerEntity },
  } = useMUD();
```

Get the MUD API information.

```ts
useKeyboardMovement();
```

Register the handler in `useKeyboardMovement.ts`.

```ts
const playerPosition = useComponentValue(Position, playerEntity);
```

This is the way you specify a listener for a MUD table in React.

```ts
const players = useEntityQuery([Has(Position)]).map((entity) => {
  const position = getComponentValueStrict(Position, entity);
  return {
    entity,
    position,
  };
});
```

Get the list of players (with the entityId and position).
Both `useComponentValue` and `useEntityQuery` cause the React component in which they are registered (in this case, `Scene`) to be rendered again when the information changes.

```ts {10-16}
.
.
.
  return (
    <group>
      <ambientLight />
      {/* eslint-disable-next-line react/no-unknown-property */}
      <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />
      <Plane position={[0, -5, 0]} />
      {players.map((p, i) => (
        <Player
          key={i}
          color={Math.floor(parseInt(p.entity) * 123456) % 16777215}
          position={[p.position.x, p.position.y, p.position.z]}
        />
      ))}
    </group>
  );
```

Return the React component, including the players.

### `useKeyboardMovement.ts`

[This file](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/templates/threejs/packages/client/src/useKeyboardMovement.ts) registers the event handler for keyboard actions.

```ts
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useMUD } from "./MUDContext";

export const useKeyboardMovement = () => {
  const {
    systemCalls: { moveBy },
  } = useMUD();
```

`useMUD()` gives us the `moveBy` system call, which lets us move.

```ts
  useEffect(() => {
    const listener = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
      if (e.key === "ArrowUp") {
        moveBy(1, 0, 0);
      }
      if (e.key === "ArrowDown") {
        moveBy(-1, 0, 0);
      }      .
      .
      .
      .
```

Call `moveBy` with different parameters depending on the key pressed.

```ts
    window.addEventListener("keydown", listener);
    return () => window.removeEventListener("keydown", listener);
  }, [moveBy]);
};
```

The second parameter of [`useEffect`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect) is a list of dependencies.
Here we only have one, `moveBy`.

### `createSystemCalls.ts`

[This file](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/templates/threejs/packages/client/src/mud/createSystemCalls.ts) is where you place the calls that go to the onchain system.
Here are two, `moveTo` and `moveBy`.

```ts
  const moveTo = async (x: number, y: number, z: number) => {
```

You can use `moveTo` to move to specific coordinates.

```ts
    /*
     * Because MoveSystem is in the root namespace, .move can be called directly
     * on the World contract.
     */
    const tx = await worldContract.write.move([x, y, z]);
    await waitForTransaction(tx);
  };
```

Create a transaction and wait for it to be included.

```ts
  const moveBy = async (deltaX: number, deltaY: number, deltaZ: number) => {
```

`moveBy` is a wrapper around `moveTo` that lets us specify movements by relative, rather than absolute, cooridnates.

```ts
    console.log({ Position, playerEntity });
    const playerPosition = getComponentValue(Position, playerEntity);

    if (playerPosition) {
      await moveTo(playerPosition.x + deltaX, playerPosition.y + deltaY, playerPosition.z + deltaZ);
    } else {
      await moveTo(deltaX, deltaY, deltaZ);
    }
  };
```

If there is a position for the player, move from there.
Otherwise, just move from `(0,0,0)`.

```ts
return {
  moveTo,
  moveBy,
};
```

Return the functions that the rest of the application can use.
