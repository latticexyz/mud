# Getting started

[The TypeScript templates](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/tree/main/templates) are provided by [Lattice](https://lattice.xyz/).

## Prerequisites

To install the TypeScript templates you need:

- [Node.js v18](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
  ```sh copy
  sudo npm install -g pnpm
  ```

## Installation

To run any of the TypeScript templates:

1. Create the template with pnpm.
   If you need, replace `tutorial` with your application name.

   ```sh copy
   pnpm create mud@next tutorial
   ```

   **Note:** The `@next` is only necessary until MUD v2.0 is officially released.

1. Select the template:

   - [Vanilla](./vanilla)
   - [React](./react)
   - [Phaser](./phaser)
   - [Three.js](./three)

1. Start the development server, which updates automatically when you modify files.

   ```sh copy
   cd tutorial
   pnpm dev
   ```

   You may receive this error message:

   ```
   [vite] Internal server error: Failed to resolve import "contracts/out/IWorld.sol/IWorld.abi.json" from "src/mud/setupNetwork.ts"
   ```

   If so, ignore it.
   It simply means the `contracts` package hasn't created the `IWorld.abi.json` file, which the `client` package needs, yet.
   As soon as it is created, the `client` package will use it.

## Using the templates

### Code organization

Other than a few utility files, most of the code is in two packages:

- `packages/contracts` contains the onchain part of the application.
- `packages/client` contains the offchain part of the application, the user interface.
  The app runs in the user's browser, in development it is served from a [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) server.
  The content of this package varies based on the template used.

### Vanilla and react

The applications in these two templates is the same.
You have an onchain counter and you can press `Increment` to increment it.

### Three.js

In this application the position of an object, the big green cube, is stored onchain.
In the user interface you can move that cube using the arrow keys, space, and ctrl.

### Phaser
