# Getting started

## Prerequisites

1. git ([download](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
2. foundry (forge, anvil, cast) ([download](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation), make sure to `foundryup` at least once)
3. node.js (v16+) ([download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
4. pnpm (`npm install pnpm --global` after installing node)

## Setup

Most projects in MUD are started by running `pnpm create mud <project name>`, but for this tutorial we've included some initial code to get you up and running quicker. This includes React components and base TailwindCSS styles.

To get started you can fork or clone from the [Emojimon starter kit repo](https://github.com/latticexyz/emojimon) or use the command below.

```bash copy
git clone git@github.com:latticexyz/emojimon.git
```

Afterwards, run the following commands to install the dependencies and start up MUD's services (anvil node, contracts deployer, and client):

```bash copy
cd emojimon && pnpm install
```

```bash copy
pnpm run dev
```

If all went well you should see this in your command line.

After deployment is successful, pop over to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and checkout your live app. At this point you can open up your code editor and get started!
