# Emojimon

In this tutorial, we're going to create a Pokémon-inspired on-chain game called Emojimon. The goal is to teach you how to build with [MUD](/), a full-stack framework for Ethereum applications and [Autonomous Worlds](https://0xparc.org/blog/autonomous-worlds). If throwing Pokéballs is familiar, then this tutorial is for you!

We recommended reading MUD's [introduction](/guides/introduction.md) and [getting started](/guides/getting_started.md) guides first. They'll give you context behind "why MUD?" and some of the choices we'll make throughout this tutorial.
