# Modifying the template

These tutorials teach you how to make various changes to [the vanilla template](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/tree/main/templates/vanilla).
This is an easy way to learn how to modify MUD functionality in various ways.

## Getting the initial version

All of these examples are based on the vanilla version of the template.
To create the basic version to modify, follow these steps:

1. Create a version 2.0 MUD starter.

   ```bash copy
   pnpm create mud@next tutorial
   ```

1. Select the **vanilla** template.

1. Change to the tutorial directory and start the application.

   ```bash copy
   cd tutorial
   pnpm run dev
   ```

1. Browse to the URL that the client package gives you.
   Usually that is `http://localhost:3000`, but it could vary if there's another application using that port.
