# Add a system

In this tutorial you add a system to decrement the counter and update the application to use it.

## Add a contract for the new system

Create a file `packages/contracts/src/systems/DecrementSystem.sol`.
Note that we could have just added a function to the existing system, `IncrementSystem.sol`.
The only reason we are adding a new system here is to see how to do it.

```solidity filename="DecrementSystem.sol" copy
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.8.0;

import { System } from "@latticexyz/world/src/System.sol";
import { Counter } from "../codegen/Tables.sol";

contract DecrementSystem is System {
  function decrement() public returns (uint32) {
    uint32 counter = Counter.get();
    uint32 newValue = counter - 1;
    Counter.set(newValue);
    return newValue;
  }
}
```

```solidity
import { System } from "@latticexyz/world/src/System.sol";
import { Counter } from "../codegen/Tables.sol";
```

The two things the system needs to know: how to be a `System` and how to access the `Counter`.

```solidity
uint32 counter = Counter.get();
```

Get the counter value.

```solidity
Counter.set(newValue);
```

Set the counter to a new value.

## Add `decrement` to the application

Having a system be able to do something doesn't help anybody unless it is called from somewhere.
In this case, the vanilla getting started front end.

1.  Edit `packages/client/src/mud/createSystemCalls.ts` to include `decrement`.
    This is the file after the changes:

        ```typescript filename="createSystemCalls.ts" copy
        import { ClientComponents } from "./createClientComponents";
        import { SetupNetworkResult } from "./setupNetwork";

        export type SystemCalls = ReturnType<typeof createSystemCalls>;

        export function createSystemCalls(
          { worldSend, txReduced$, singletonEntity }: SetupNetworkResult,
          { Counter }: ClientComponents
        ) {
          const increment = async () => {
            const tx = await worldSend("increment", []);
            await awaitStreamValue(txReduced$, (txHash) => txHash === tx.hash);
            return getComponentValue(Counter, singletonEntity);
          };

          const decrement = async () => {
            const tx = await worldSend("decrement", []);
            await awaitStreamValue(txReduced$, (txHash) => txHash === tx.hash);
            return getComponentValue(Counter, singletonEntity);
          };

          return {
            increment,
            decrement,
          };
        }
        ```

        The new function is `decrement`.

        ```typescript
        const decrement = async () => {
        ```

        This function involves sending a transaction, which is a slow process, so it needs to be [asynchronous](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_async.asp).

        ```typescript
        const tx = await worldSend("decrement", []);
        ```

        This is the way we call functions in top-level systems in a world.
        The second parameter, the list, is for the function parameters.
        In this case there aren't any, so it is empty.

        ```typescript
        await awaitStreamValue(txReduced$, (txHash) => txHash === tx.hash);
        ```

        Await until we receive confirmation that the transaction has been added to a block.

        ```typescript
            return getComponentValue(Counter, singletonEntity)
        };
        ```

        Get the value of `Counter` to return it.
        It should already be the updated value.

        ```typescript
        return {
          increment,
          decrement,
        };
        ```

        Of course, we also need to return `decrement` so it can be used elsewhere.

            </details>

1.  Update `packages/client/src/index.ts` to include `decrement`.
    This is the file after the changes:

        ```typescript filename="index.ts" copy
        import { mount as mountDevTools } from "@latticexyz/dev-tools";
        import { setup } from "./mud/setup";

        const {
          components,
          systemCalls: { decrement, increment },
        } = await setup();

        // Components expose a stream that triggers when the component is updated.
        components.Counter.update$.subscribe((update) => {
          const [nextValue, prevValue] = update.value;
          console.log("Counter updated", update, { nextValue, prevValue });
          document.getElementById("counter")!.innerHTML = String(nextValue?.value ?? "unset");
        });

        // Just for demonstration purposes: we create a global function that can be
        // called to invoke the Increment system contract via the world. (See IncrementSystem.sol.)
        (window as any).increment = async () => {
          console.log("new counter value:", await increment());
        };

        (window as any).decrement = async () => {
          console.log("new counter value:", await decrement());
        };

        mountDevTools();
        ```

           <details>

        ```typescript
        const {
          components,
          systemCalls: { decrement, increment },
        } = await setup();
        ```

        This syntax means the we call [`setup()`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/examples/minimal/packages/client-vanilla/src/mud/setup.ts), and then set `components`, `systemCalls.increment`, and `systemCalls.decrement` to the values provided in the hash returned by this function.
        `systemCalls` comes from `createSystemCalls()`, which we modified in the previous step.

        ```typescript
        (window as any).decrement = async () => {
          console.log("new counter value:", await decrement());
        };
        ```

        We need to make `decrement` available to our application code.
        Most frameworks have a standard mechanism to do this, but we are using `vanilla`, which doesn't - so we add it to `window` which is a global variable.

1.  Modify `packages/client/index.html` to add a decrement button.
    This is the file after the changes:

        ```html filename="index.html" copy
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
          <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8" />
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
            <title>a minimal MUD client</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <script type="module" src="/src/index.ts"></script>
            <div>Counter: <span id="counter">0</span></div>
            <button onclick="window.increment()">Increment</button>
            <button onclick="window.decrement()">Decrement</button>
          </body>
        </html>
        ```

           <details>

        <p></p>

        ```html
        <button onclick="window.decrement()">Decrement</button>
        ```

        Create a [`button`](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_button.asp) with an [`onClick`](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ev_onclick.asp) property.

           </details>

1.  Reload the application to see that there is a decrement button and that you can use it.
