# Batch calls

Batch calls allow a single call to the `World` to perform multiple `System` calls.
Using [`batchCall`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/world/src/modules/core/implementations/BatchCallSystem.sol#L15-L33) you can issue calls on your own behalf.
If you have the proper [delegations](/world/account-delegation), you can also use [`batchCallFrom`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/world/src/modules/core/implementations/BatchCallSystem.sol#L35-L53) to issue `System` calls on behalf of other addresses.

The calls take place sequentially, and after they all finish successfully you get back the return values from all of them.
If any of the calls revert, so does `batchCall` / `batchCallFrom`, so all the state changes created by the previous calls are discarded.
