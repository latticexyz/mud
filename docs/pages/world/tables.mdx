# Tables

`World` uses the [store tables](/store/tables), but adds [access control](/world/namespaces-access-control).
For onchain tables, the data is stored by the `World` contract, [which is also a `StoreData`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/world/src/World.sol#L43).

When a `System` reads or writes storage via [table libraries](/store/table-libraries), the request goes into [`StoreSwitch`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/store/src/StoreSwitch.sol). This library decides which approach to use:

- If the `System` is in the root namespace, then it was called with [`delegatecall`](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.22/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#delegatecall-and-libraries).
  This means it inherits the `World` storage and can write directly to storage using [`StoreCore`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/store/src/StoreCore.sol).
  These calls bypass access control.

- If the `System` is in any other namespace, then it was called with [`call`](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.22/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#message-calls) and has to call back into the `World` using [`IStore`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/store/src/IStore.sol).
  These calls go through access control.
  They are only permitted if the `System` has access to the table in question.
  By default a `System` has access to its own namespace and therefore to all the tables inside it.
  Additional [access can be granted](./namespaces-access-control) by the namespace owner.
