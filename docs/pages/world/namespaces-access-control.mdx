# Namespaces and Access Control

Access control in a `World` is based on namespaces.
Every resource is part of a namespace (a blank namespace refers to the `root` namespace).
Access to resources is managed by the owner of the namespace.

Access control can be attached to [any resource](/world/resource-ids).

## Access control levels

There are three access levels in MUD.

### "No" access

This is the level that most users of a MUD application have for all resources.
Users on this level are allowed to do the following:

- Read data from tables.
  Any information posted or created on the blockchain is public, so this information is available anyway.
- Call functions on [public `System`s](./systems).

### Access

This level of access is often required for software that is part of the application.
Access can be granted either on a namespace basis (access to the namespace gives access to all the resources inside it) or on an individual resource.

Entities with this level of access can do anything that "no" access allows, and also:

- Write directly to tables.
  This is as opposed to users with no access, who can only modify table information by going through a public `System` (by default, a `System` has access to its own namespace, which includes all of the namespace's tables).
- Call functions on [private `System`s](./systems).
- In the case of access to a namespace, withdraw from the ETH balance of the namespace.
  To avoid giving this permission, you can give an address access to every resource in the namespace, rather than to the namespace itself.

### Ownership

`Namespace` is the only resource type that has an owner.
The owner is a single account (but by using multi-sig accounts ownership can be shared).

The owner is an administrative account, a superuser.
When you change ownership, the new owner gets access to the namespace, and the old owner loses it.
Therefore, owners can do anything an address with access can.
Additionally, owners can also:

- Grant and revoke access within the namespace (either to the namespace itself or to resources inside it).
- Transfer namespace ownership.
- Register a [namespace delegation control](/world/account-delegation).
- Register new [tables](/store/tables).
- Register [store hooks](/store/store-hooks) for tables in the namespace.
- Register new [systems](/world/systems).
- Upgrade existing systems.
- Register [system hooks](/world/system-hooks) for systems in the namespace.
- Register [function selectors](/world/function-selectors) for systems in the namespace.

Owners can modify which contract a `World` uses for each `System`.
Note: once ownership of a namespace is burned (i.e. transferred to `address(0)`), no new access can be granted or revoked, ownership can't be transferred again, and `System`s can't be added, removed, or upgraded (unless the `System` is itself a [proxy](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/proxy-patterns)).

## Modifying access control

By default access to a namespace is granted to:

- The namespace owner
- The `System`s of that namespace

Namespace access provides access to all the resources within the namespace, so there is no need, by default, for access to the resources within the namespace.

If that is insufficient, [`AccessManagementSystem`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/world/src/modules/init/implementations/AccessManagementSystem.sol) lets you [`grantAccess`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/world/src/modules/init/implementations/AccessManagementSystem.sol#L18-L33), [`revokeAccess`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/world/src/modules/init/implementations/AccessManagementSystem.sol#L35-L47), and [`transferOwnership`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/world/src/modules/init/implementations/AccessManagementSystem.sol#L49-L73) of a namespace.

For example, here is a script that grants access to the `Counter` table to one address and revokes it for another.

<CollapseCode>

```solidity filename="Permissions.s.sol" copy {7-8,20-21}
pragma solidity >=0.8.21;

import { Script } from "forge-std/Script.sol";
import { console } from "forge-std/console.sol";
import { StoreSwitch } from "@latticexyz/store/src/StoreSwitch.sol";

import { IWorld } from "../src/codegen/world/IWorld.sol";
import { Counter } from "../src/codegen/index.sol";

contract Permissions is Script {
  function run() external {
    address worldAddress = 0xC14fBdb7808D9e2a37c1a45b635C8C3fF64a1cc1;

    // Load the private key from the `PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable (in .env)
    uint256 namespaceOwnerPrivateKey = vm.envUint("PRIVATE_KEY");

    // Start broadcasting transactions from the account owning the namespace
    vm.startBroadcast(namespaceOwnerPrivateKey);

    IWorld(worldAddress).grantAccess(Counter._tableId, address(0));
    IWorld(worldAddress).revokeAccess(Counter._tableId, address(1));

    vm.stopBroadcast();
  }
}
```
