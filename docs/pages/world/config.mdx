## The World config

In order to use World, your project needs a MUD framework config that can be interpreted by the deployer and the test-runner. Currently, the configuration parser supports typescript, but more format will come later (if you really despise javascript as an example ü•≤).

The configuration file needs to be named `mud.config.ts` and in the same folder as your `foundry.toml` file. You‚Äôll notice it‚Äôs the same configuration file as for Store: if you are already using Store, using World is as easy as adding additional fields to your config!

The config is used to define:

1. All the tables in your project in the `tables` object of your configuration. You can head to the [Store documentation](../store) to read more about the format for tables.
2. The namespace the systems and tables will be deployed in.
3. The systems in your project. By default, the deployer will find all Solidity matching `*System*.sol` (so any file containing `System` with a `.sol` extension, in any folder) and deploy them as System. If you want greater control over your systems (to change their public access or their name), you can use the `systems` object in the config
4. The modules that will be installed on the World. More on this in the [Modules section](module)

An example of a World config with all the different configuration keys and options used:

```tsx
import { mudConfig } from "@latticexyz/world/register";
import { resolveTableId } from "@latticexyz/config";

export default mudConfig({
  excludeSystems: ["System3", "System2"],
  worldContractName: "CustomWorld",
  namespace: "mud",
  systems: {
    IncrementSystem: {
      name: "increment",
      openAccess: true,
    },
  },
  tables: {
    CounterTable: {
      schema: {
        value: "uint32",
      },
    },
  },
  deploysDirectory: "./mud-deploys",
  modules: [
    {
      name: "KeysWithValueModule",
      root: true,
      args: [resolveTableId("CounterTable")],
    },
  ],
});
```

### Global configuration keys

**`namespace` (optional)**: a `string`: which namespace to deploy the resources defined in the config into. The default value is the ROOT namespace.

**`excludeSystems` (optional)**: an array of `string`: which systems to not deploy, even if their name includes ‚Äúsystem‚Äù.

**`worldContractName` (optional)**: a `string`: the name of a contract in your project implementing the `IWorld` interface. Useful if you want to modify the default World implementation. Here be dragons üê≤

**`deploysDirectory` (optional)** a `string`: which folder to put the deployment artifacts into after deployment.

**`modules` (optional)** an array of module definition: module definition have a `name`, `root` (optional), and `args` key.

`name`: Name of the module to instantiate. The same module can be instantiated multiple times. This should be the name of the contract file without `.sol` (eg: if the contract is named `DopeModule.sol`, the name of the module is `DopeModule`)

`root`: wether to create a `root` module or not. `root` modules have access to all tables and are not bound to namespace restrictions.

`args`: a list of arguments to be sent to the `install` function of the module. In this array, you can use special functions:

1. `resolveTableId`: This function will turn a table name from your config into its low-level ID in the World. Useful to pass references of a table to a module.

### System configuration keys

Adding a system is done by adding an entry to the **`systems`** key. The name of the record is the name of the file (if your system is named `SystemA.sol`, use `SystemA` as the key to add to the **`systems`** dictionary.

Example:

```tsx
import { mudConfig } from "@latticexyz/world/register";

export default mudConfig({
  systems: {
    SystemA: {
      name: "systema",
      openAccess: true,
    },
  },
  tables: {},
});
```

The system configuration can have these properties:

**`fileSelector` (optional)**: a `string`: the file selector for the system.

**`openAccess` (optional)**: a `bool`: if set to `false`, only the systems in the same namespace and the addresses or systems listed from the accessList. Default is `true`.

**`accessList` (required if openAccess is `false`)**: an array of `string`. Each address in the array will be granted access to this system, allowing them to call it.
