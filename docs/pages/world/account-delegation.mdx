# Account delegation

_Account delegation_ allows a _delegator_ address to permit a _delegatee_ address to call a `System` on its behalf.
This enables multiple use cases.

- **Session wallets**.
  Normally a wallet requires the user to authorize each transaction separately.
  In the case of a blockchain game, this means having to authorize every move, which is excessive.
  Using account delegation players can authorize a different wallet, one whose private key is stored on the client, to act on their behalf.
  Because this wallet's private key is stored in the client, rather than a browser extension, the client can decide when asking for authorization is warranted and when it isn't.
  By making sure this is a _separate_ wallet, we protect the player's main account in the case of vulnerable or malicious game clients.

- **Approvals**.
  Users can approve contracts to perform actions in a MUD world on their behalf.
  This is conceptually similar to how ERC20's [`approve`/`transferFrom`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20#transferfrom) enables atomic swaps by allowing contracts to withdraw from a user's balance and then deposit a different asset in a single transaction.
  For example, an agent could exchange two in-game assets atomically if the two sides of the trade give it the necessary permission.

## Creating a delegation

First, the delegator has to call [`registerDelegation`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/world/src/modules/core/implementations/WorldRegistrationSystem.sol#L234-L263).
This function takes three parameters:

- `delegatee`, the address given the privileges.
  This can be `address(0)` to let this delegation apply to all callers. Note that combining `address(0)` with an unlimited delegation is discouraged, as it would allow anyone to perform any action on behalf of the delegator.

- `delegationControlId`, this is usually the `ResourceId` for a `System` that decides whether an attempt to do something by the delegatee on behalf of the delegator is authorized or not.
  Alternatively, this value can be [`UNLIMITED_DELEGATION`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/world/src/constants.sol#L23-L25), in which case the delegatee has unlimited authority.

  We have an example of a delegation control `System` in [the `std-delegations` module](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/tree/main/packages/world-modules/src/modules/std-delegations).

- `initCallData`, call data for a function that is called on the `delegationControlId` to inform it of the new delegation.
  This [call data](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html) includes both the function selector of the function to call and arguments to pass to the function (the result of `abi.encodeCall`) .

## Using a delegation

The delegatee can use [`callFrom`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/world/src/World.sol#L353-L394).
This function takes three parameters:

- `delegator`, the address on whose behalf the call is happening.
- `systemId`, the `System` to call.
- `callData`, the [call data](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html) to send the `System`, which includes both the function selector and arguments (the result of `abi.encodeCall`).

## Namespace delegation

The owner of a namespace can use [`registerNamespaceDelegation`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/world/src/modules/core/implementations/WorldRegistrationSystem.sol#L265-L306) to register a delegation that applies to all callers of systems in this namespace.
This functionality is useful, for example, to implement a trusted forwarder for the namespace.
This is not a security concern because the namespace owner already has full control over any table or `System` in the namespace.

## Order of delegation checks

As you can see in [`callFrom`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/world/src/World.sol#L353-L394), the order of delegation checks is:

1. If there is a `world:UserDelegationControl` entry with the delegator and the delegatee (a.k.a. `msg.sender`), check it.
   If it results in an approval, perform the call.
1. If the user provided a fallback delegation (one where the delegatee is `address(0)`), check it.
   If it results in an approval, perform the call.
1. If there is an applicable namespace delegation, check that one.
   If it results in an approval, perform the call.

This means that if there's a namespace delegation that modifies information (for example, writes to a MUD table to gather statistics) users will be able to bypass it by creating their own delegation with the same delegetee and a `System` that would approve.
