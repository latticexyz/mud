# ERC 721 (NFT) module

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">

This module is unaudited and may change in the future.

</Callout>

The [`erc721-puppet`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/tree/main/packages/world-modules/src/modules/erc721-puppet) module lets you create [ERC-721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) NFTs as part of a MUD `World`.
The advantage of doing this, rather than creating a separate [NFT contract](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/master/contracts/token/ERC721) and merely controlling it from MUD, is that all the information is in MUD tables and is immediately available in the client.

## Deployment

To deploy this module you use a Solidity script.
To use the one here, first edit `.env` to make sure we have these environment variables.

(1) The reason to use `DDDD` is that in ASCII it is 0x44444444, which makes debugging easier.
Of course, not a production system you'd use a meaningful name.
