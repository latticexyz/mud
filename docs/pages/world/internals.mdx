## Internal tables and systems of World

World uses [`Store internals`](/store/internals), because it calls `StoreCore.initialize` in its constructor.

World's own internals are initialized via the [`deploy`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/cli/src/utils/deploy.ts) cli utility (because they would exceed max contract size if called in a constructor).

Except `NamespaceOwner` is initialized in World's constructor, because it's needed for module access checks.

### Tables

- `NamespaceOwner` - maps namespace to its owner's address
- `ResourceAccess` - maps selector (tableId / system selector) and caller address to access flag
- `InstalledModules` - maps name and arguments hash (so a module can be installed multiple times) to the module's address
- `Systems` - maps a system's selector (`namespace` + `name`) to its contract addresses and `publicAccess` flag
- `SystemRegistry` - reverse maps a system's address to its selector
- `SystemHooks` - maps a system's selector to an array of table hooks
- `ResourceType` - maps selector to a `Resource` enum value. Helps differentiate between systems, tables, etc, because they all share the same resource pool
- `FunctionSelectors` - maps selector of a function registered on World to its details: function's system namespace, name and selector. The system's function selector can be different from World's function selector.

### Systems

Internal systems are in `core` module's [implementations](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/tree/main/packages/world/src/modules/core/implementations) folder, because they're installed by `CoreModule`.

- `AccessManagementSystem` - grants/revokes access to/from resources
- `EphemeralRecordSystem` - has `emitEphemeralRecord` for ephemeral tables
- `ModuleInstallationSystem` - installation of (non-root) modules in the World
- `StoreRegistrationSystem` - _its methods should not be used with the World framework_. Surfaces the APIs necessary to register Tables on-chain, but lacks namespaces used by World for better permission checks
- `WorldRegistrationSystem` - surfaces the APIs necessary to register Systems, Tables, and Namespaces on-chain
