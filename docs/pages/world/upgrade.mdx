# Upgrading worlds

The [`System`s](./systems) can be upgraded without changing the underlying `World` code.
However, if the `World` was deployed [behind a proxy](/config#upgradeableWorldImplementation) it is also possible to upgrade the `World` itself.
This allows you to upgrade to a future version if MUD, but adds some gas overhead for all calls (due to one more level of indirection).

## Are upgrades possible?

As per [ERC-1967](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1967#logic-contract-address), the storage slot `0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc` stores the address of the `World` implementation in a proxy.
So to identify if a `World` is deployed behind a proxy run these commands:

```sh copy
WORLD_ADDRESS=0xbe6b85dc88f969e45d8d8ae128c5a9c9744d6464
cast implementation $WORLD_ADDRESS
```

If the answer is anything other than zero, the `World` is behind a proxy and can be upgraded.

## Performing an upgrade

To upgrade the `World` use these steps in a `package/contracts` directory:

1. Edit `.env` to add `WORLD_ADDRESS` with the address displayed by MUD Dev Tools.
   For example, you might want to use this file:

   <CollapseCode>

   ```sh filename=".env" showLineNumbers copy {12}
   # This .env file is for demonstration purposes only.
   #
   # This should usually be excluded via .gitignore and the env vars attached to
   # your deployment environment, but we're including this here for ease of local
   # development. Please do not commit changes to this file!
   #
   # Enable debug logs for MUD CLI
   DEBUG=mud:*
   #
   # Anvil default private key:
   PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
   WORLD_ADDRESS=0xbe6b85dc88f969e45d8d8ae128c5a9c9744d6464
   ```

   </CollapseCode>

1. Create this script in `scripts/UpgradeWorld.s.sol`.

   <CollapseCode>

   ```solidity filename="UpgradeWorld.s.sol" copy showLineNumbers {18,23}
   // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
   pragma solidity >=0.8.24;

   import { Script } from "forge-std/Script.sol";
   import { console } from "forge-std/console.sol";

   import { World } from "@latticexyz/world/src/World.sol";
   import { WorldProxy } from "@latticexyz/world/src/WorldProxy.sol";

   contract SetImplementation is Script {
     function run() external {
       uint256 deployerPrivateKey = vm.envUint("PRIVATE_KEY");
       vm.startBroadcast(deployerPrivateKey);

       address proxyAddress = vm.envAddress("WORLD_ADDRESS");

       // Deploy new world implementation
       World newWorld = new World();

       console.log("proxy:", proxyAddress);
       console.log("new World:", address(newWorld));

       WorldProxy(payable(proxyAddress)).setImplementation(address(newWorld));

       vm.stopBroadcast();
     }
   }
   ```

   </CollapseCode>

1. Run the script.

   ```sh copy
   forge script script/UpgradeWorld.s.sol --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --broadcast
   ```

1. See the new address.

   ```sh copy
   source .env
   cast implementation $WORLD_ADDRESS
   ```
