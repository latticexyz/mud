## Quick start

Let's create your first project with MUD!

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed.

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v18
- Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-npm) with `npm install -g pnpm`
- Install [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

> **Note for Windows users**: You may have additional steps/prerequisites to install things like Foundry. We're still working on docs for these.

### Create a new project

It's easy to start a new project with MUD. Just run the following command:

```
pnpm create mud@canary your-project-name
```

You'll be prompted to pick the type of template to use (vanilla JS or React).

### Run your project

Jump into your new project's directory. In one terminal, run the anvil node with:

```
pnpm run dev:node
```

And in another terminal, run the app with:

```
pnpm run dev
```

Under the hood, `dev` will do a few different steps:

- Generates code to make it easier and safer to interact with MUD
- Deploys contracts to the local anvil node
- Starts the client app
