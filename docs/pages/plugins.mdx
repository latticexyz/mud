## Plugins

<Aside emoji="⚠️">
  Currently, only config extension API is implemented, and it will likely change. Generator hooks (for `tablegen`,
  `worldgen`, etc) and cli extension API will be available in the future.
</Aside>

Plugins are just npm packages that execute `extendMUDCoreConfig` when imported, and export some interface extensions.

The `config` package provides the core of MUD API.
Both `store` and `world` are plugins themselves, although `store` is special because it introduces `mudConfig`.

Plugins can depend on other plugins, and most are expected to depend on `store` and `world`.

### Plugins for the MUD framework

MUD framework means that your plugin will depend on `world`, which in turn depends on `store`.

Start with [`Basic plugin example`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/examples/minimal/packages/plugin-example/ts), which shows how to add an option (but it does nothing with it).

Plugins can take advantage of [Modules](world/modules) to add solidity logic to `world`.

You can use [`world/ts/register`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/world/ts/register/index.ts) as an advanced example, since `world` is a plugin.

#### `/register` vs `/library`

You can have as many folders and exports as you want, but the main one is `/register`.
When imported, `/register` has side-effects (changes interfaces and a global variable), which is why it should be isolated.

You want to import `/register` in `mud.config.ts` and another plugin's `configExtensions`, `typeExtensions`.

You want to import `/library` in most library-like code, like generators and utilities.

#### `typeExtensions`

You can't override typescript types.
`typeExtensions` augments existing interfaces (and this works only for interfaces) by [merging interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html#merging-interfaces).

The augmented interface is propagated:

- recursively, to any file that imports `typeExtensions.ts`. But only `import "somepackage"` works, not `import { foo } from "somepackage"`
- to its entire package, which is why you should put plugins into separate packages to avoid them polluting each other's interfaces

#### `configExtensions`

`extendMUDCoreConfig` adds its callback to an array, stored in a global variable (akin to hardhat's plugins).

All these callbacks get called, in the order they were added, within `mudConfig`
(aside from being a type helper, that's all `mudConfig` does - calls callbacks. `store` and `world` plugins are also just callbacks in that array).
