## ðŸŽ© Not Monopoly

### What happens to real estate when ownership is fluid?

- Experiment on Permanent Auction Mechanics
- Set base rules and allow for actors to try to reach balance

### Ruleset

- No explicit goal. Implicit: make more $MONEY
- 32x32 grid
- TURN based; at every TURN:
  - TAXES are paid
  - a random COLUMN and ROW are picked
  - all owners of tiles in picked ROW and COLUMN get $2 (intersection tile gets $4)
  - BUYOUTs are paid
  - ownership is transferred to BUYERS, money is transferred back
  - BUYERS define new tax on recently bought tiles, new PRICE is set (PRICE = TAX \* 10)
- Game never ends
