## ðŸ¤‘ Coin war

### Trying to get all the monies

- Goal is to get the most $MONEY
- Every player (wallet) starts with 10,000 of their own coin
- They can exchange the coins with other players for their own coin
- Every cycle (n blocks) 2 $MONEY are created
  - One transferred to the wallet with the most diverse collection of coins (if a tie, than the largest amount of coins)
  - One transferred to the wallet(s) with least diverse collection of coins. In this case, the $MONEY gets split amongst wallets that are in the same state
- If wallet gets empty it is dead and cannot receive any coin. Maybe a wallet with only one coin

### Why onchain?

- It's all about the shilling and pushing your coin to someone else
- The coins that are created by the players have no value, only the one that is truly scarce
- Lots of open space for sybil attack, collusion and gaming the system
