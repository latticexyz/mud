## üè¶ DeFi-in-a-box

A tool that allows users to easily create the basics of DeFi:

- Automated Market Maker, with a Liquidity Pool
- Token Minter
- Staking contract

With this setting, we can wrap the tools around a simulated constraint and have it behave like a game (think OPCraft)

### Rules:

- Goal is to make as much $OG as possible
- $OG is created: 10,000 units, no more will be created for the duration of the game
- $OG is distributed amongst players
  - Options here: lump sum on create account, drip as they engage with application
- All tools cost $OG to be used (minting, dex, etc)
- By creating their own tokens and hyping them up, players trade to get more $OG
- At the end of the pre-determined time, the player with the largest amount $OG wins
