## ♟️ Client agnostic chess

### A game of chess with the entire logic on chain

- Playable from “terminal” by sending transactions
- The first player has to build the interface to bring someone to play with them

### Why onchain?

- Puts interoperability first, someone has to build on top of what is there
- Two players can play the same match from completely different clients
