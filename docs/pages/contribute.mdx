# Contribute

We'd love your support in improving MUD! [The MUD monorepo](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud) includes all of MUD's source code, and pull requests are always welcome.
To discuss new features or changes [join our Discord](https://lattice.xyz/discord).

You can find a list of good first issues (that don't require a lot of context on the full system) at [contribute.mud.dev](https://contribute.mud.dev).

## Local development setup

The following steps are only necessary if you want to contribute to MUD. To use MUD in your project, [set up a new project with the MUD CLI](/quick-start).

1. Ensure you have these applications installed:

   | Software                                                 | Tested with version |
   | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
   | [`curl`](https://curl.se/)                               | 7.74.0              |
   | [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) | 20.x                |
   | [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/)                               | 9.x                 |
   | [`Foundry`](https://getfoundry.sh/)                      | latest              |

1. Download the source code for MUD.

   ```sh copy
   git clone https://github.com/latticexyz/mud.git
   cd mud
   ```

1. Install and build packages.

   ```sh copy
   pnpm install
   pnpm build
   ```

### Using your repository in an application

To check the changes in an application, run these commands at the application's root.

```sh copy
pnpm mud set-version --link /relative/path/to/local/mud
pnpm install
```

While the application's `pnpm dev` is running, any time you `pnpm build` the MUD repository the application gets updated automatically.

## Pull requests

MUD follows the [conventional commit specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for PR titles.
Please keep the scope of your PR small (rather open multiple small PRs than one huge PR).
