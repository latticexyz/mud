## Installation

### Environment variables

These environment variables need to be provided to the indexer to work:

| Type     | Variable         | Meaning                                                                                                  | Sample value (using `anvil` running on the host)          |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Required | RPC_HTTP_URL     | The URL to access the blockchain using HTTP                                                              | http://host.docker.internal:8545 (when running in Docker) |
| Optional | RPC_WS_URL       | The URL to access the blockchain using WebSocket                                                         |
| Optional | START_BLOCK      | The block to start indexing from. The block in which the `World` contract was deployed is a good choice. | 1                                                         |
| Optional | DEBUG=mud:\*     | Turn on debugging                                                                                        |                                                           |
| Optional | STORE_ADDRESS    | Only index tables from this `World`                                                                      |
| Required | DATABASE_URL     | URL for the database, of the form `postgres://<host>/<database>`                                         |
| Optional | PORT             | The port on which the indexer listens                                                                    | `3001` (the default)                                      |
| Optional | FOLLOW_BLOCK_TAG | The block tag to index. Options: `latest`, `safe`, `finalized`. Defaults to `safe`.                      | safe                                                      |

### Using npx

The schemaless indexer stores MUD event records into a single monolithic table.
The main purpose of this variant of the indexer is to efficiently hydrate a MUD client, which decodes the data from the events.

1. Start a `World` to index.
   An easy way to do this is to [use a TypeScript template](/templates/typescript/getting-started) in a separate command line window.

1. Set the environment variables.

   ```bash copy
   export RPC_HTTP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545
   export DATABASE_URL=postgres://127.0.0.1/postgres
   ```

1. Run the indexer.
   Install it first if necessary.

   ```bash copy
   npx -y -p @latticexyz/store-indexer postgres-indexer
   ```

1. Open a separate command line.
   In it, specify the database and run the indexer frontend, which is responsible for serving the data to the client.

   ```bash copy
   export DATABASE_URL=postgres://127.0.0.1/postgres
   npx -y -p @latticexyz/store-indexer postgres-frontend
   ```

### Docker

The indexer Docker image is available [on github](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pkgs/container/store-indexer).

There are several ways to provide the environment variables to `docker run`:

- On the command line you can specify `-e <variable>=<value>`.
  You specify this after the `docker run`, but before the name of the image.
- You can also write all the environment variables in a file and specify it using `--env-file`.
  You specify this after the `docker run`, but before the name of the image.
- Both [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) have their own mechanisms for starting docker containers with environment variables.

The easiest way to test the indexer is to [run the template as a world](/templates/typescript/getting-started) in a separate command-line window.

The command to start the indexer in event-only PostgreSQL mode is `pnpm start:postgres`.
This command starts both the indexer and query frontends.

1. The docker instance identifies itself to PostgreSQL as `root`.
   To give this user permissions on the database, enter `psql` and run this command.

   ```sql copy
   CREATE ROLE root SUPERUSER LOGIN;
   ```

   **Note:** This is assuming a database that is isolated from the internet and only used by trusted entities.
   In a production system you will use at least a password as authentication, and limit the user's authority.

1. Start the docker container.
   For example, to index an `anvil` instance running to the host to the database `postgres` on the host, use.

   ```sh copy
   docker run \
     --platform linux/amd64 \
     -e RPC_HTTP_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8545 \
     -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://host.docker.internal/postgres \
     -p 3001:3001  \
     ghcr.io/latticexyz/store-indexer:latest  \
     pnpm start:postgres
   ```

   If you want to create additional query frontends (for reliability and load balancing), use these commands:

   ```sh copy
   HOST_PORT=3002
   docker run \
     --platform linux/amd64 \
     -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://host.docker.internal/postgres \
     -p $HOST_PORT:3001  \
     ghcr.io/latticexyz/store-indexer:latest  \
     node dist/bin/postgres-frontend.js
   ```

## Using the indexer

[See here how to use the indexer with a MUD client](using-indexer).

### Viewing events

You can run this command to verify the indexer is working correctly.

```sh copy
curl 'http://localhost:3001/api/logs?input=%7B%22chainId%22%3A31337%2C%22address%22%3A%220x8d8b6b8414e1e3dcfd4168561b9be6bd3bf6ec4b%22%2C%22filters%22%3A%5B%5D%7D' | jq
```

The result should be nicely formatted (and long) JSON output with all the data change events that happened in that `World`.

<details>

<summary>Where does this URL come from?</summary>

The URL has these parameters:

| Parameter | Value                 | Explanation                                 |
| --------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Server    | http://localhost:3001 | By default the indexer listens on port 3001 |
| Path      | /api/logs             | Read log events                             |
| `input`   | `%7B%22 ... %5D%7D`   | See below                                   |

The input is the JSON filter that tells the server what we need.
It is [URL encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding), you can decode it [using an online calculator](https://www.urldecoder.org/).

```json
{
  "chainId": 31337,
  "address": "0x8d8b6b8414e1e3dcfd4168561b9be6bd3bf6ec4b",
  "filters": []
}
```

Meaning that the query is for all events in the `World` at address `0x8d8b6b8414e1e3dcfd4168561b9be6bd3bf6ec4b`, on the chain with chain ID `31337`.

</details>

### Clearing the information

If you restart the blockchain, you need to clear all the information stored by the indexer otherwise you'll have an inconsistent state.
The events are all in the `mud` schema:

```sql copy
DROP SCHEMA "mud" CASCADE;
```
