# mud faucet

This command is deprecated. It can still be used to interact with the deprecated faucet service on the deprecated "lattice testnet", but will be removed in the future.

We recommend to use the [Redstone Holesky testnet](https://redstone.xyz) and new [faucet service](/services/faucet). See [the sample client program](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/tree/main/examples/faucet-client) for a usage example.
