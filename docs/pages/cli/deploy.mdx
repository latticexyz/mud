# mud deploy

This command deploys a MUD app to a blockchain.

## Using the command

Before you run `mud deploy` you need to specify the private key of the deploying account.
There are several ways to do this:

- Export an environment variable.

  ```sh copy
  export PRIVATE_KEY=0x<key goes here>
  ```

- Edit `.env` to specify the `PRIVATE_KEY` value.

  ```sh copy
  # This .env file is for demonstration purposes only.
  #
  # This should usually be excluded via .gitignore and the env vars attached to
  # your deployment environment, but we're including this here for ease of local
  # development. Please do not commit changes to this file!
  #
  # Anvil default private key:
  PRIVATE_KEY=0x59c6995e998f97a5a0044966f0945389dc9e86dae88c7a8412f4603b6b78690d
  ```

You also need to specify a URL to the blockchain.
Again, there are several ways to do this:

- Use the `--rpc <url>` command line parameter.
- Specify the URL as the `eth_rpc_url` value [in a profile in `foundry.toml`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/config/).
  If the profile isn't the default, use `--profile <profile name>`.

These are the command line options you can specify on `mud deploy`:

(1) The hostname `localhost` may not work. If that is the case, use `127.0.0.1` instead.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  If you want to [verify](./verify) the contracts that make up the `World`, do it right after deployment. Verification
  only works with the original source code, compiler options, and compiled artifacts. Otherwise, the generated bytecode
  is different and therefore verification fails.
</Callout>

## Examples

### New `World`

To create a new `World` you can use this command line:

```sh copy
pnpm mud deploy --rpc <url>
```

This command also writes the `World`'s address to `worlds.json`.

### Upgrading a World

To upgrade a `World`'s `System`s and tables, you can use this command line:

```sh copy
pnpm mud deploy --rpc <url> --worldAddress <address>
```

If properly configured, [there is also a way to upgrade the core MUD contracts](/world/upgrades).

## Debugging

To generate debug messages, use this command:

```sh copy
export DEBUG=mud:cli:deploy
```

## Interaction with the templates

The [TypeScript templates](/quickstart#using-the-templates) provided by Lattice all include two packages:

- `contracts`, which contain the onchain components: contracts, call to start `anvil` to have a local blockchain, etc.
- `client`, which contains the offchain components: the `vite` HTTP server, the TypeScript code, etc.

When you develop locally, you run `pnpm dev` from the root of the template and that runs both packages.
However, when you deploy to a different blockchain you don't need `anvil` running anymore, so instead you:

1. Use `pnpm mud deploy` in the `packages/contracts` directory to deploy to the appropriate blockchain.
1. Specify the chain on which you installed the contracts in the `VITE_CHAIN_ID` environment variable.
   For example, if you installed on [Garnet](https://garnetchain.com/docs/network-info), run this command.

   ```sh copy
   export VITE_CHAIN_ID=17069
   ```

1. Run `pnpm vite` in the `packages/clients` directory to start the user interface.
   If you want to use a different chain ID than the one specified for vite, use the `chainId` URL parameter.
   For example, if you deployed both to Garnet and a local `anvil` instance, you can use [`http://localhost:3000/?chainId=31337`](http://localhost:3000/?chainId=31337) to get to the local instance regardless of the `VITE_CHAIN_ID` value.
