# The World config

Certain CLI commands, such as [`mud tablegen`](/cli/tablegen) and [`mud worldgen`](/cli/worldgen) require the MUD configuration file.
This file needs to be named `mud.config.ts` and be in the same folder as your `foundry.toml` file.

The config is used to define:

- The tables in your project in the `tables` object of your configuration.
- The [namespace](/world/namespaces-access-control) the [`System`s](/world/systems) and tables will be deployed in.
- The `System`s in your project.
  By default, the deployer will find all Solidity matching `*System.sol` (so any file ending in `System.sol`, in any folder) and deploy them as public `System`.
  If you want greater control over your systems (to change their public access or their name), you can use the `systems` object in the config.
- The [modules](/world/modules) that will be installed in the `World`.

The is an example of a `World` config:

```tsx
import { mudConfig } from "@latticexyz/world/register";
import { resolveTableId } from "@latticexyz/config";

export default mudConfig({
  excludeSystems: ["System3", "System2"],
  worldContractName: "CustomWorld",
  namespace: "mud",
  systems: {
    IncrementSystem: {
      name: "increment",
      openAccess: true,
    },
  },
  tables: {
    CounterTable: {
      valueSchema: {
        value: "uint32",
      },
    },
  },
  deploysDirectory: "./mud-deploys",
  modules: [
    {
      name: "KeysWithValueModule",
      root: true,
      args: [resolveTableId("CounterTable")],
    },
  ],
});
```

## Global configuration keys

The global configuration keys are all optional.

- **`namespace`**: a `string`: which namespace to deploy the resources defined in the config into.
  The default value is the ROOT namespace.

- **`excludeSystems`**: an array of `string`: which systems to not deploy, even if their name ends with “System”.

- **`worldContractName`**: a `string`: the name of a contract in your project implementing the `IWorld` interface.
  Useful if you want to modify the default World implementation, but potentially dangerous.
- **`deploysDirectory`** a `string`: which folder to put the deployment artifacts into after deployment.

- **`modules`** an array of module definitions: each module definition has a `name`, `root` (optional), and `args` key.

  - `name`: Name of the module to install. The same module can be installed multiple times. This should be the name of the contract file without `.sol` (eg: if the file is named `DopeModule.sol`, the name of the module is `DopeModule`)

  - `root`: whether to create a `root` module or not. `root` modules have access to all tables and are not bound to namespace restrictions.

  - `args`: a list of arguments to be sent to the `install` function of the module. In this array, you can use the function `resolveTableId`. This function will turn a table name from your config into its low-level ID in the World. It is useful to pass references of a table to a module.

- **`systems`**: a record of system definitions. The keys in the record are file names without the `.sol` extension. For example, if your system is named `TestSystem.sol`, use `TestSystem` as the key.

  The value is a record of system configuration properties:

  - `fileSelector` (optional): a `string`: the file selector for the system.
  - `openAccess` (optional, default `true`): a `bool`: if set to `false`, only the systems in the same namespace and the addresses or systems listed in the the `accessList` array have access.

  - `accessList` (required if openAccess is `false`): an array of `string`. Each address in the array will be granted access to this system, allowing them to call it.

- **`tables`**: a record of tables. The keys in the record are table names.
  The value is a record of [table properties](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/store/ts/config/storeConfig.ts#L110-L135).

  - **`valueSchema`** (record):
    The keys of this record are the field names of the value (which should start with a lowercase letter).
    The values are strings that contain the data types of the fields.
    Note that this is the sole required field, all the others are optional.

  - **`keySchema`** (record):
    The keys of this record are the field names of the key (which should start with a lowercase letter).
    The values are strings that contain the data types of the fields.

    The default value is:

    ```json
    { "key": "bytes32" }
    ```

    For a singleton table (one that contains a single row), use `{}` as the key schema.

  - **`directory`** (string):
    Directory in which to create the table.
    The default is `tables`, so by default tables are created in `src/codegen/tables`.

  - **`tableIdArgument`** (bool):
    Make methods accept `tableId` argument instead of it being a hardcoded constant.
    The default is `false` because you can achieve the same result using [`StoreSwitch`](/store/table-libraries#storeswitch).

  - **`storeArgument`** (bool):
    Include methods that accept a manual `IStore` argument.
    The default is `true`.

  - **`dataStruct`**: (bool):
    Include a [data struct](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.23/types.html#structs) and methods for it.
    Default is false for 1-column tables; true for multi-column tables.

    Sample code for using a table library with `dataStruct`:

    ```solidity
    // no data struct
    MyTable.set(keccak256("some.key"), 1, 12, "foo");
    // data struct
    MyTable.set(keccak256("some.key"), { field1: 1, field2: 12, stringField: "foo" });
    ```
