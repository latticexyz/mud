# mud verify

This command uploads the source code for the deployed contracts to a public repository, such as a block explorer.
The repository then compiles the source code and verifies that the compiled version is identical to what is deployed onchain.

The best time to perform verification is immediately after [deployment](./deploy).
Verification only works with the original source code, compiler options, and compiled artifacts.
Otherwise, the generated bytecode is different and therefore verification fails.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Currently, on Blockscout `mud verify` verifies the `System`s that are part of your application, but not
  the MUD contracts themselves. On Sourcify `mud verify` verifies all the contracts.

[See below](#verifying-library-contracts) for how to verify library contracts on Blockscout.

## Using the command

1. If using Blockscout, specify the API key:

   ```sh copy
   export ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=<value goes here>
   ```

   With Blockscout you don't _have_ to specify the API key.
   However, there is a limited number of requests allowed for accounts without an API key per second, so you get much more reliable service if you do.
   To get an API key, use the URL for the Blockscout explorer for the blockchain where your contract is located followed by `/account/api-key`.
   For example, for Redstone you'd use [`https://explorer.redstone.xyz/account/api-key`](https://explorer.redstone.xyz/account/api-key).

1. Run the command.

   ```sh copy
   pnpm mud verify --worldAddress <address here> --rpc <RPC to the blockchain> [--verifier <verifier>]
   ```

   These are the command line options you can specify on `mud verify`:

   | Option           | Meaning                                                | Type    | Default value                |
   | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | ---------------------------- |
   | `--worldAddress` | Verify the contracts of the World at the given address | string  | none, error if unspecified   |
   | `--configPath`   | Path to the config file                                | string  | `mud.config.ts`              |
   | `--verifier`     | The verifier to use (`sourcify`, or `blockscout`)      | string  | `blockscout`                 |
   | `--verifierUrl`  | URL to use to access the verifier's API                | string  | depends on the verifier used |
   | `--profile`      | The foundry profile to use                             | string  | `local`                      |
   | `--rpc`          | URL to the blockchain                                  | string  |                              |
   | `--srcDir`       | Source directory                                       | string  | Foundry `src` directory      |
   | `--version`      | Show version number                                    | boolean | `false`                      |

   Note that it takes block explorers some time to process new contracts.
   You should wait 5-10 minutes past deployment before you verify the contract on Blockscout.

## Examples

- To verify the world at that address on Holesky on [sourcify](https://sourcify.dev/):

  ```sh
  WORLD_ADDRESS=0x816038e244ff78b86a5e7dec9bf281634fb6d2a2
  HOLESKY_RPC=https://ethereum-holesky.publicnode.com
  pnpm mud verify --rpc $HOLESKY_RPC --worldAddress $WORLD_ADDRESS
  ```

- To verify a contract on Holesky for users of [Blockscout](https://www.blockscout.com/):

  ```sh
  WORLD_ADDRESS=0x816038e244ff78b86a5e7dec9bf281634fb6d2a2
  HOLESKY_RPC=https://ethereum-holesky.publicnode.com
  export ETHERSCAN_API_KEY= ** blockscout API key goes here **
  pnpm mud verify --rpc $HOLESKY_RPC --worldAddress $WORLD_ADDRESS --verifier blockscout --verifier-url https://eth-holesky.blockscout.com/api
  ```

## Manual contract verification

`mud verify` only verifies contracts in your own project, not those imported from other packages.
In most cases, those contracts are already verified and the block explorer will show you the source code regardless.
However, if they are not, you can use `forge verify-contract` to verify them manually.
Here are step by step directions when using Blockscout.

1. Set the following environment variables:

   | Variable           | Value                                                    |
   | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
   | BLOCKSCOUT_API_KEY | Blockscout API key                                       |
   | ADDRESS            | Contract address                                         |
   | CONTRACT           | The contract<sup>1</sup>                                 |
   | API_URL            | Blockscout API URL (the explorer URL followed by `/api`) |
   | RPC_URL            | RPC HTTP URL for the blockchain                          |

   (1) The path from the `contracts` package, followed by a colon and the contract name.
   For example, `node_modules/@latticexyz/world-modules/src/modules/erc721-puppet/ERC721System.sol:ERC721System`.

2. Run this command:

   ```sh copy
   forge verify-contract --verifier blockscout \
    --verifier-url $API_URL --rpc-url $RPC_URL \
    --etherscan-api-key $BLOCKSCOUT_API_KEY $ADDRESS $CONTRACT
   ```
