# System Best Practices

## Security considerations

### Avoid the root namespace if possible

A `System` in the root namespace costs slightly less gas because it uses the `World` context, including storage, and does not need to call the `World` back to read or write information.
However, because it runs in the `World` context, there are security risks in writing such a `System`.

- A root namespace `System` can overwrite information in tables.
  This means, for example, it can create [any delegation that it wants](/world/account-delegation) by modifying `world__UserDelegationControl`.
- Any [ETH owned by a namespace in the `World`](/world/balance) is actually stored in the `World` and therefore can be sent anywhere by such a `System`.
- A root namespace `System` can call any other `System` with arbitrary values for [`_msgSender()`](/world/reference/world-context#_msgsender) and [`_msgValue()`](/world/reference/world-context#_msgvalue).
  This means it can perform any action while pretending to be any user.

This violates the security principle of [_least privilege_](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/least_privilege).
Ideally, you should avoid running in the root namespace.

  If you _have_ to use a `System` in the root namespace, avoid using
  [`delegatecall`](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.16/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#delegatecall-callcode-and-libraries),
  except for libraries whose security you verified. Any contract you call with `delegatecall` is going to inherit the
  `World` context, and have unlimited permissions on your application.

## Design consideraions

### One call, one action

If you want a transaction to do multiple actions (for example: register, start a game, and then perform the first move in the game), you don't need a `DoThis_DoThat_AndThen_DoTheOtherThing` function.
Just use [batch calls](/world/batch-calls), which preserve the message sender (in `\_msgSender()).

### Use delegation for user agents

If a `System` is going to act on the users' behalf, it will need to call other `System`s, probably in other namespaces.
The way to do this is to request users to [delegate their permissions](/world/account-delegation).
This is necessary because:

- If you call another `System` through the `World`, the message sender (`_msgSender()`) is the calling `System`.
  The called `System` has no way of knowing if it can trust the caller `System` to represent the wishes of the ultimate user.
  See [the Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.25/security-considerations.html#tx-origin) for an in-depth explanation.
- If you `delegatecall` another `System` directly you keep `_msgSender()`'s value, but the called `System` is only allowed to perform actions allowed to the calling `System`.

### Don't send ETH with your calls

The way [ETH balances](/world/balance) work in MUD, _all_ ETH is stored in the `World` contract and internally accounted as belonging to namespaces.
If your `System` is in the root namespace it has access to this ETH, but if you transfer out except through [`BalanceTransferSystem`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/world/src/modules/init/implementations/BalanceTransferSystem.sol), you need to update the accounting table.
If your `System` is not in the root namespace it does not have direct access to the ETH anyway.
You _have_ to use `BalanceTransferSystem`.

## Implementation considerations

### Use libraries to bypass the contract size limit

If you have a large `System` and you come up against the [contract size limit](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/#limitations), don't split it in two.
Instead, use [public libraries](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#libraries).
Libraries are called using [`delegatecall`](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#delegatecall-and-libraries), so they have the same permissions as the calling contract.
This includes the ability to write to MUD tables when the calling `System` is permitted to do so.
