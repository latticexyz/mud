# MUD tutorials

These tutorials teach you how to do various things with MUD.

## Modifying the template

[These tutorials](tutorials/minimal) teach you how to make various changes to [the application template](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/tree/main/examples/minimal).
This is an easy way to learn how to modify MUD functionality in various ways.

- [Add a table](tutorials/minimal/add-table):
  In this tutorial you add a table to preserve counter history, and learn how to lookup information using a key.
- [Add a system](tutorials/minimal/add-system):
  In this tutorial you add a system to decrement the counter and update the application to use it.
- [Use MUD from onchain code](tutorials/minimal/use-onchain):
  In this tutorial you learn how to use a `World` and the systems in it from code that runs on the blockchain.
  You can use this knowledge to add sub-systems to a `World` or to use MUD as part of a bigger dapp.
- [Deploy to a blockchain](tutorials/minimal/deploy):
  In this tutorial you deploy the application to a public blockchain, either the Lattice test blockchain or a general purpose one.

## Walkthrough

[These tutorials](tutorials/walkthrough) are deep dives into various sections of code.

- [The onchain components of the template](tutorials/walkthrough/onchain):
  In this tutorial you learn how to understand the onchain components of the minimal template.

## Emojimon

[This tutorial](tutorials/emojimon) is a complete game, explaining how to create the data model, systems to manipulate it onchain, and then user interface.
