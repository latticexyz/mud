# Deploy to testnet
Lattice provides a testnet you can deploy to with one-second block times (compared to the ~12 seconds of Ethereum mainnet). This is a great way to share your game with others.

## Deploy the contracts
From your `packages/contracts` directory, you'll run `pnpm deploy:testnet` to deploy them to the testnet. You may need to provide the testnet RPC URL, as well as your deployer's privat key. Make sure to use the faucet to get some testnet ether!

## Deploy the client
We still have a few kinks to work out in MUD to make deploying the client as easy as possible, but you can still build and deploy manually.

From your `packages/client` directory, you'll run `pnpm build` to build the client. Then, you can deploy the packages/client/dist directory to a static hosting service like Netlify or Cloudflare Pages.

We'll be adding more deploy guides for providers like Vercel in the near future. Stay tuned!
