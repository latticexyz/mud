# MUD config

Certain CLI commands, such as [`mud tablegen`](/cli/tablegen) and [`mud worldgen`](/cli/worldgen) require the MUD configuration file.
This file needs to be named `mud.config.ts` and be in the same folder as your `foundry.toml` file.

The config is used to define:

- The tables in your project in the `tables` object of your configuration.
- The [namespace](/world/namespaces-access-control) that [systems](/world/systems) and tables will be deployed in.
- The `System`s in your project.
  By default, the deployer will find all Solidity matching `*System.sol` (so any file ending in `System.sol`, in any folder) and deploy them as public `System`.
  If you want greater control over your systems (to change their public access or their name), you can use the `systems` object in the config.
- The [modules](/world/modules) that will be installed in the `World`.

The is an example of a `World` config:

```tsx
import { defineWorld } from "@latticexyz/world";

export default defineWorld({
  enums: {
    TerrainType: ["None", "TallGrass", "Boulder"],
  },
  excludeSystems: ["System3", "System2"],
  worldContractName: "CustomWorld",
  namespace: "mud",
  systems: {
    IncrementSystem: {
      name: "increment",
      openAccess: true,
    },
  },
  tables: {
    Counter: {
      schema: {
        value: "uint32",
      },
      key: [],
    },
    Tasks: {
      schema: {
        id: "bytes32",
        createdAt: "uint256",
        completedAt: "uint256",
        description: "string",
      },
      key: ["id"],
    },
  },
  deploysDirectory: "./mud-deploys",
});
```

## Global configuration keys

The global configuration keys are all optional.

- **`namespace`**: a `string`: which namespace to deploy the resources defined in the config into.
  The default value is the ROOT namespace.

- **`tables`**: a record of tables. The keys in the record are table names.
  The value is a record of [table properties](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/store/ts/config/storeConfig.ts#L110-L135).

  - **`schema`** (record):
    The keys of this record are the field names in the data, which includes both the key fields and the value fields.
    By convention, these keys start with a lowercase letter.
    The values are strings that contain the data types of the fields.
    Note that this is the sole required field, all the others are optional.

  - **`key`** (list):
    A list of the `schema` fields that are the key for that table.
    If you want a singleton table, use an empty list (as in `Counter` table above).

  - **`type`** (either `table` or `offchainTable`): [The table type](/store/tables#types-of-tables).
    The default is `table`, which is a table stored onchain.
    If you specify `offchainTable`, the table's data is only available offchain through events.

- **`systems`**: a record of system definitions. The keys in the record are file names without the `.sol` extension. For example, if your system is named `TestSystem.sol`, use `TestSystem` as the key.

  The value is a record of system configuration properties:

  - `registerFunctionSelectors` (optional, default `true`): a `bool`.
    Whether we want to automatically register the `public` functions of the `System` as
    [function selectors](/world/function-selectors)
  - `openAccess` (optional, default `true`): a `bool`.
    If set to `false`, only the systems in the same namespace and the addresses or systems listed in the `accessList` array have access.
  - `accessList` (required if openAccess is `false`): an array of `string`. Each address in the array will be granted access to this system, allowing them to call it.

- **`enums`**: a record of [enumerations](https://solidity-by-example.org/enum/).
  The keys are the names of the enumerations.
  The values are arrays of the strings for the values the enumeration can take.

- **`tables`**: a record of tables. The keys in the record are table names.
  The value is a record of [table properties](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/store/ts/config/storeConfig.ts#L110-L135).

- **`excludeSystems`**: an array of `string`: which systems to not deploy, even if their name ends with “System”.

- **`modules`** an array of module definitions: each module definition has a `name`, `root` (optional), and `args` key.

  - `name`: Name of the module to install. The same module can be installed multiple times. This should be the name of the contract file without `.sol` (eg: if the file is named `DopeModule.sol`, the name of the module is `DopeModule`)

  - `root`: whether to create a `root` module or not. `root` modules have access to all tables and are not bound to namespace restrictions.

  - `args`: a list of arguments to be sent to the `install` function of the module. In this array, you can use the function `resolveTableId`. This function will turn a table name from your config into its low-level ID in the World. It is useful to pass references of a table to a module.

- **`codegen`**: a record of code generation options.

  - **`worldInterfaceName`** a `string`: The name of the interface for the `World`.
    The default value is `IWorld`.
  - **`worldgenDirectory`** a `string`: The directory for system and world interfaces.
    The default value is `world`.

- **`deploy`**: a record of deployment options.

  - **`postDeployScript`** a `string`: Script to execute after the deployment is complete.
    This script must be placed in the forge scripts directory (see `foundry.toml`) and have a `.s.sol` extension.
    The default is `PostDeploy`.

  - **`deploysDirectory`** a `string`: Which folder to put the deployment artifacts into after deployment.
    The default is `./deploys`.

  - **`worldsFile`** a `string`: JSON file for the chain to `World` deploy address mapping.
    The default is `./worlds.json`.

  - <a id="upgradeableWorldImplementation" />
    **`upgradeableWorldImplementation`** a `bool`: Whether the `World` is to be deployed behind a proxy to [enable upgrades
    of the core World implementation](/world/upgrades). The default is `false`.
