  <p>MUD - Engine for Autonomous Worlds</p>
</div>

MUD is a framework for complex Ethereum applications.

It adds some conventions for organizing data and logic and abstracts away low-level complexities so you can focus on the features of your app.

It standardizes the way data is stored on-chain.
With this standard data model, MUD can provide all network code to synchronize contract and client state. This includes synchronizing state directly from an RPC node or a general-purpose MUD indexer.

MUD is MIT-licensed, open source and free to use.

## Features

![MUD features](/features.png)

### Today

- State synchronization between contracts and clients without custom networking code
- General purpose indexers (without custom indexing code)
- Seamless contract upgrades (+ automatic contract upgrades during development)
- Shared contract state
- Optimistic updates
- Automatic type generation for contracts and systems
- Query language to interact with contract state
- Data explorer to inspect and modify contract and local state
- Bitpacking utilities

### Soon

- Local simulation of transactions (including optimistic state)
- Built-in support for account abstraction
- Contract package manager

## Quickstart

```
pnpm create mud my-project
```

## Packages

MUD consists of several libraries. They can be used independently, but are best used together.

### Local development setup

!!!
The following steps are only necessary if you want to contribute to MUD. To use MUD in your project, install the [packages](#packages) from npm or [set up a new project with the MUD cli](#quickstart).
!!!

1. Install go (required to build [packages/services](packages/services/)): [https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install)

2. Install the foundry toolkit (required to build and test MUD solidity packages): [https://getfoundry.sh/](https://getfoundry.sh/)

3. Install pnpm

```bash
npm install pnpm --global
```

4. Clone the MUD monorepo

```
git clone https://github.com/latticexyz/mud
```

5. Install MUD dependencies and setup local environment

```
cd mud && pnpm install
```

### Pull requests

MUD follows the [conventional commit specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages and PR titles. Please keep the scope of your PR small (rather open multiple small PRs than one huge PR) and follow the conventional commit spec.
