# 13. Make it your own

You're probably thinking of a bunch of ways to continue expanding on the Emojimon world, but here are some ideas:

- Make it so you can’t walk through/over other players
- Show a list of monsters you’ve caught
- Add more terrain types and monster types
- Make certain monsters spawn more often than others
- Make certain monsters harder to catch
- Add an inventory with a limited number of emojiballs

Have fun!
