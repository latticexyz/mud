# Change Log

## 2.0.0-next.13

### Minor Changes

- b1d41727: Added a `mapObject` helper to map the value of each property of an object to a new value.

### Patch Changes

- 3e057061: Removed chalk usage from modules imported in client fix downstream client builds (vite in particular).
  - @latticexyz/schema-type@2.0.0-next.13

## 2.0.0-next.12

### Minor Changes

- 06605615: - Added a `sendTransaction` helper to mirror viem's `sendTransaction`, but with our nonce manager
  - Added an internal mempool queue to `sendTransaction` and `writeContract` for better nonce handling
  - Defaults block tag to `pending` for transaction simulation and transaction count (when initializing the nonce manager)
- d2f8e940: Renames `resourceIdToHex` to `resourceToHex` and `hexToResourceId` to `hexToResource`, to better distinguish between a resource ID (hex value) and a resource reference (type, namespace, name).

  ```diff
  - resourceIdToHex({ type: 'table', namespace: '', name: 'Position' });
  + resourceToHex({ type: 'table', namespace: '', name: 'Position' });
  ```

  ```diff
  - hexToResourceId('0x...');
  + hexToResource('0x...');
  ```

  Previous methods still exist but are now deprecated to ease migration and reduce breaking changes. These will be removed in a future version.

  Also removes the previously deprecated and unused table ID utils (replaced by these resource ID utils).

### Patch Changes

- f62c767e: Moved some codegen to use `fs/promises` for better parallelism.
- 25086be5: Replaced temporary `.mudtest` file in favor of `WORLD_ADDRESS` environment variable when running tests with `MudTest` contract
  - @latticexyz/schema-type@2.0.0-next.12

## 2.0.0-next.11

### Minor Changes

- d075f82f: - Moves contract write logic out of `createContract` into its own `writeContract` method so that it can be used outside of the contract instance, and for consistency with viem.

  - Deprecates `createContract` in favor of `getContract` for consistency with viem.
  - Reworks `createNonceManager`'s `BroadcastChannel` setup and moves out the notion of a "nonce manager ID" to `getNonceManagerId` so we can create an internal cache with `getNonceManager` for use in `writeContract`.

  If you were using the `createNonceManager` before, you'll just need to rename `publicClient` argument to `client`:

  ```diff
    const publicClient = createPublicClient({ ... });
  - const nonceManager = createNonceManager({ publicClient, ... });
  + const nonceManager = createNonceManager({ client: publicClient, ... });
  ```

### Patch Changes

- 16b13ea8: Adds viem workaround for zero base fee used by MUD's anvil config
- f99e8898: Bump viem to 1.14.0 and abitype to 0.9.8
- Updated dependencies [f99e8898]
  - @latticexyz/schema-type@2.0.0-next.11

## 2.0.0-next.10

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies []:

## 2.0.0-next.9

### Major Changes

- [#1550](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1550) [`65c9546c`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/65c9546c4ee8a410b21d032f02b0050442152e7e) Thanks [@dk1a](https://github.com/dk1a)! - - Add `renderWithFieldSuffix` helper method to always render a field function with a suffix, and optionally render the same function without a suffix.

  - Remove `methodNameSuffix` from `RenderField` interface, because the suffix is now computed as part of `renderWithFieldSuffix`.

- [#1558](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1558) [`bfcb293d`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/bfcb293d1931edde7f8a3e077f6f555a26fd1d2f) Thanks [@alvrs](https://github.com/alvrs)! - What used to be known as `ephemeral` table is now called `offchain` table.
  The previous `ephemeral` tables only supported an `emitEphemeral` method, which emitted a `StoreSetEphemeralRecord` event.

  Now `offchain` tables support all regular table methods, except partial operations on dynamic fields (`push`, `pop`, `update`).
  Unlike regular tables they don't store data on-chain but emit the same events as regular tables (`StoreSetRecord`, `StoreSpliceStaticData`, `StoreDeleteRecord`), so their data can be indexed by offchain indexers/clients.

  ```diff
  - EphemeralTable.emitEphemeral(value);
  + OffchainTable.set(value);
  ```

- [#1544](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1544) [`5e723b90`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/5e723b90e6b18bc70d357ff4b0a1b217611236ae) Thanks [@alvrs](https://github.com/alvrs)! - - `ResourceSelector` is replaced with `ResourceId`, `ResourceIdLib`, `ResourceIdInstance`, `WorldResourceIdLib` and `WorldResourceIdInstance`.

  Previously a "resource selector" was a `bytes32` value with the first 16 bytes reserved for the resource's namespace, and the last 16 bytes reserved for the resource's name.
  Now a "resource ID" is a `bytes32` value with the first 2 bytes reserved for the resource type, the next 14 bytes reserved for the resource's namespace, and the last 16 bytes reserved for the resource's name.

  Previously `ResouceSelector` was a library and the resource selector type was a plain `bytes32`.
  Now `ResourceId` is a user type, and the functionality is implemented in the `ResourceIdInstance` (for type) and `WorldResourceIdInstance` (for namespace and name) libraries.
  We split the logic into two libraries, because `Store` now also uses `ResourceId` and needs to be aware of resource types, but not of namespaces/names.

  ```diff
  - import { ResourceSelector } from "@latticexyz/world/src/ResourceSelector.sol";
  + import { ResourceId, ResourceIdInstance } from "@latticexyz/store/src/ResourceId.sol";
  + import { WorldResourceIdLib, WorldResourceIdInstance } from "@latticexyz/world/src/WorldResourceId.sol";
  + import { RESOURCE_SYSTEM } from "@latticexyz/world/src/worldResourceTypes.sol";

  - bytes32 systemId = ResourceSelector.from("namespace", "name");
  + ResourceId systemId = WorldResourceIdLib.encode(RESOURCE_SYSTEM, "namespace", "name");

  - using ResourceSelector for bytes32;
  + using WorldResourceIdInstance for ResourceId;
  + using ResourceIdInstance for ResourceId;

    systemId.getName();
    systemId.getNamespace();
  + systemId.getType();

  ```

  - All `Store` and `World` methods now use the `ResourceId` type for `tableId`, `systemId`, `moduleId` and `namespaceId`.
    All mentions of `resourceSelector` were renamed to `resourceId` or the more specific type (e.g. `tableId`, `systemId`)

    ```diff
    import { ResourceId } from "@latticexyz/store/src/ResourceId.sol";

    IStore {
      function setRecord(
    -   bytes32 tableId,
    +   ResourceId tableId,
        bytes32[] calldata keyTuple,
        bytes calldata staticData,
        PackedCounter encodedLengths,
        bytes calldata dynamicData,
        FieldLayout fieldLayout
      ) external;

      // Same for all other methods
    }
    ```

    ```diff
    import { ResourceId } from "@latticexyz/store/src/ResourceId.sol";

    IBaseWorld {
      function callFrom(
        address delegator,
    -   bytes32 resourceSelector,
    +   ResourceId systemId,
        bytes memory callData
      ) external payable returns (bytes memory);

      // Same for all other methods
    }
    ```

### Minor Changes

- [#1354](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1354) [`331dbfdc`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/331dbfdcbbda404de4b0fd4d439d636ae2033853) Thanks [@dk1a](https://github.com/dk1a)! - `readHex` was moved from `@latticexyz/protocol-parser` to `@latticexyz/common`

- [#1566](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1566) [`44a5432a`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/44a5432acb9c5af3dca1447c50219a00894c45a9) Thanks [@dk1a](https://github.com/dk1a)! - - Add `getRemappings` to get foundry remappings as an array of `[to, from]` tuples.

  - Add `extractUserTypes` solidity parser utility to extract user-defined types.
  - Add `loadAndExtractUserTypes` helper to load and parse a solidity file, extracting user-defined types.

- [#1354](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1354) [`331dbfdc`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/331dbfdcbbda404de4b0fd4d439d636ae2033853) Thanks [@dk1a](https://github.com/dk1a)! - `spliceHex` was added, which has a similar API as JavaScript's [`Array.prototype.splice`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice), but for `Hex` strings.

  ```ts
  spliceHex("0x123456", 1, 1, "0x0000"); // "0x12000056"
  ```

- [#1473](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1473) [`92de5998`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/92de59982fb9fc4e00e50c4a5232ed541f3ce71a) Thanks [@holic](https://github.com/holic)! - Bump Solidity version to 0.8.21

- [#1513](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1513) [`708b49c5`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/708b49c50e05f7b67b596e72ebfcbd76e1ff6280) Thanks [@Boffee](https://github.com/Boffee)! - Generated table libraries now have a set of functions prefixed with `_` that always use their own storage for read/write.
  This saves gas for use cases where the functionality to dynamically determine which `Store` to use for read/write is not needed, e.g. root systems in a `World`, or when using `Store` without `World`.

  We decided to continue to always generate a set of functions that dynamically decide which `Store` to use, so that the generated table libraries can still be imported by non-root systems.

  ```solidity
  library Counter {
    // Dynamically determine which store to write to based on the context
    function set(uint32 value) internal;

    // Always write to own storage
    function _set(uint32 value) internal;

    // ... equivalent functions for all other Store methods
  }
  ```

- [#1581](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1581) [`cea754dd`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/cea754dde0d8abf7392e93faa319b260956ae92b) Thanks [@alvrs](https://github.com/alvrs)! - - The external `setRecord` and `deleteRecord` methods of `IStore` no longer accept a `FieldLayout` as input, but load it from storage instead.
  This is to prevent invalid `FieldLayout` values being passed, which could cause the onchain state to diverge from the indexer state.
  However, the internal `StoreCore` library still exposes a `setRecord` and `deleteRecord` method that allows a `FieldLayout` to be passed.
  This is because `StoreCore` can only be used internally, so the `FieldLayout` value can be trusted and we can save the gas for accessing storage.

  ```diff
  interface IStore {
    function setRecord(
      ResourceId tableId,
      bytes32[] calldata keyTuple,
      bytes calldata staticData,
      PackedCounter encodedLengths,
      bytes calldata dynamicData,
  -   FieldLayout fieldLayout
    ) external;

    function deleteRecord(
      ResourceId tableId,
      bytes32[] memory keyTuple,
  -   FieldLayout fieldLayout
    ) external;
  }
  ```

  - The `spliceStaticData` method and `Store_SpliceStaticData` event of `IStore` and `StoreCore` no longer include `deleteCount` in their signature.
    This is because when splicing static data, the data after `start` is always overwritten with `data` instead of being shifted, so `deleteCount` is always the length of the data to be written.

    ```diff

    event Store_SpliceStaticData(
      ResourceId indexed tableId,
      bytes32[] keyTuple,
      uint48 start,
    - uint40 deleteCount,
      bytes data
    );

    interface IStore {
      function spliceStaticData(
        ResourceId tableId,
        bytes32[] calldata keyTuple,
        uint48 start,
    -   uint40 deleteCount,
        bytes calldata data
      ) external;
    }
    ```

  - The `updateInField` method has been removed from `IStore`, as it's almost identical to the more general `spliceDynamicData`.
    If you're manually calling `updateInField`, here is how to upgrade to `spliceDynamicData`:

    ```diff
    - store.updateInField(tableId, keyTuple, fieldIndex, startByteIndex, dataToSet, fieldLayout);
    + uint8 dynamicFieldIndex = fieldIndex - fieldLayout.numStaticFields();
    + store.spliceDynamicData(tableId, keyTuple, dynamicFieldIndex, uint40(startByteIndex), uint40(dataToSet.length), dataToSet);
    ```

  - All other methods that are only valid for dynamic fields (`pushToField`, `popFromField`, `getFieldSlice`)
    have been renamed to make this more explicit (`pushToDynamicField`, `popFromDynamicField`, `getDynamicFieldSlice`).

    Their `fieldIndex` parameter has been replaced by a `dynamicFieldIndex` parameter, which is the index relative to the first dynamic field (i.e. `dynamicFieldIndex` = `fieldIndex` - `numStaticFields`).
    The `FieldLayout` parameter has been removed, as it was only used to calculate the `dynamicFieldIndex` in the method.

    ```diff
    interface IStore {
    - function pushToField(
    + function pushToDynamicField(
        ResourceId tableId,
        bytes32[] calldata keyTuple,
    -   uint8 fieldIndex,
    +   uint8 dynamicFieldIndex,
        bytes calldata dataToPush,
    -   FieldLayout fieldLayout
      ) external;

    - function popFromField(
    + function popFromDynamicField(
        ResourceId tableId,
        bytes32[] calldata keyTuple,
    -   uint8 fieldIndex,
    +   uint8 dynamicFieldIndex,
        uint256 byteLengthToPop,
    -   FieldLayout fieldLayout
      ) external;

    - function getFieldSlice(
    + function getDynamicFieldSlice(
        ResourceId tableId,
        bytes32[] memory keyTuple,
    -   uint8 fieldIndex,
    +   uint8 dynamicFieldIndex,
    -   FieldLayout fieldLayout,
        uint256 start,
        uint256 end
      ) external view returns (bytes memory data);
    }
    ```

  - `IStore` has a new `getDynamicFieldLength` length method, which returns the byte length of the given dynamic field and doesn't require the `FieldLayout`.

    ```diff
    IStore {
    + function getDynamicFieldLength(
    +   ResourceId tableId,
    +   bytes32[] memory keyTuple,
    +   uint8 dynamicFieldIndex
    + ) external view returns (uint256);
    }

    ```

  - `IStore` now has additional overloads for `getRecord`, `getField`, `getFieldLength` and `setField` that don't require a `FieldLength` to be passed, but instead load it from storage.

  - `IStore` now exposes `setStaticField` and `setDynamicField` to save gas by avoiding the dynamic inference of whether the field is static or dynamic.

  - The `getDynamicFieldSlice` method no longer accepts reading outside the bounds of the dynamic field.
    This is to avoid returning invalid data, as the data of a dynamic field is not deleted when the record is deleted, but only its length is set to zero.

### Patch Changes

- [#1585](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1585) [`0b8ce3f2`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/0b8ce3f2c9b540dbd1c9ba21354f8bf850e72a96) Thanks [@alvrs](https://github.com/alvrs)! - Minor fix to resolving user types: `solc` doesn't like relative imports without `./`, but is fine with relative imports from `./../`, so we always append `./` to the relative path.

- [#1587](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1587) [`24a6cd53`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/24a6cd536f0c31cab93fb7644751cb9376be383d) Thanks [@alvrs](https://github.com/alvrs)! - Changed the `userTypes` property to accept `{ filePath: string, internalType: SchemaAbiType }` to enable strong type inference from the config.

- [#1598](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1598) [`c4f49240`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/c4f49240d7767c3fa7a25926f74b4b62ad67ca04) Thanks [@dk1a](https://github.com/dk1a)! - Table libraries now correctly handle uninitialized fixed length arrays.

- [#1311](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1311) [`331f0d63`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/331f0d636f6f327824307570a63fb301d9b897d1) Thanks [@alvrs](https://github.com/alvrs)! - Deprecate `@latticexyz/std-client` and remove v1 network dependencies.

  - `getBurnerWallet` is replaced by `getBurnerPrivateKey` from `@latticexyz/common`. It now returns a `Hex` string instead of an `rxjs` `BehaviorSubject`.

    ```
    - import { getBurnerWallet } from "@latticexyz/std-client";
    + import { getBurnerPrivateKey } from "@latticexyz/common";

    - const privateKey = getBurnerWallet().value;
    - const privateKey = getBurnerPrivateKey();
    ```

  - All functions from `std-client` that depended on v1 network code are removed (most notably `setupMUDNetwork` and `setupMUDV2Network`). Consumers should upgrade to v2 networking code from `@latticexyz/store-sync`.

  - The following functions are removed from `std-client` because they are very use-case specific and depend on deprecated code: `getCurrentTurn`, `getTurnAtTime`, `getGameConfig`, `isUntraversable`, `getPlayerEntity`, `resolveRelationshipChain`, `findEntityWithComponentInRelationshipChain`, `findInRelationshipChain`. Consumers should vendor these functions if they are still needed.

  - Remaining exports from `std-client` are moved to `/deprecated`. The package will be removed in a future release (once there are replacements for the deprecated exports).

    ```diff
    - import { ... } from "@latticexyz/std-client";
    + import { ... } from "@latticexyz/std-client/deprecated";
    ```

### Patch Changes

- [#1315](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1315) [`bb6ada74`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/bb6ada74016bdd5fdf83c930008c694f2f62505e) Thanks [@holic](https://github.com/holic)! - Initial sync from indexer no longer blocks the promise returning from `createStoreSync`, `syncToRecs`, and `syncToSqlite`. This should help with rendering loading screens using the `SyncProgress` RECS component and avoid the long flashes of no content in templates.

  By default, `syncToRecs` and `syncToSqlite` will start syncing (via observable subscription) immediately after called.

  If your app needs to control when syncing starts, you can use the `startSync: false` option and then `blockStoreOperations$.subscribe()` to start the sync yourself. Just be sure to unsubscribe to avoid memory leaks.

  ```ts
  const { blockStorageOperations$ } = syncToRecs({
    ...
    startSync: false,
  });

  // start sync manually by subscribing to `blockStorageOperation# Change Log
  const subcription = blockStorageOperation$.subscribe();

  // clean up subscription
  subscription.unsubscribe();
  ```

This is useful for wiring up the transanction log in MUD dev tools.

  ```ts
  import { createContract, ContractWrite } from "@latticexyz/common";
  import { Subject } from "rxjs";

  const write$ = new Subject<ContractWrite>();
  creactContract({

### Major Changes

- [#1214](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1214) [`60cfd089`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/60cfd089fc7a17b98864b631d265f36718df35a9) Thanks [@holic](https://github.com/holic)! - Templates and examples now use MUD's new sync packages, all built on top of [viem](https://viem.sh/). This greatly speeds up and stabilizes our networking code and improves types throughout.

  These new sync packages come with support for our `recs` package, including `encodeEntity` and `decodeEntity` utilities for composite keys.

  If you're using `store-cache` and `useRow`/`useRows`, you should wait to upgrade until we have a suitable replacement for those libraries. We're working on a [sql.js](https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js/)-powered sync module that will replace `store-cache`.

  **Migrate existing RECS apps to new sync packages**

  As you migrate, you may find some features replaced, removed, or not included by default. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/issues/new) and let us know if we missed anything.

  1. Add `@latticexyz/store-sync` package to your app's `client` package and make sure `viem` is pinned to version `1.3.1` (otherwise you may get type errors)

  2. In your `supportedChains.ts`, replace `foundry` chain with our new `mudFoundry` chain.

     ```diff
     - import { foundry } from "viem/chains";
     - import { MUDChain, latticeTestnet } from "@latticexyz/common/chains";
     + import { MUDChain, latticeTestnet, mudFoundry } from "@latticexyz/common/chains";

     - export const supportedChains: MUDChain[] = [foundry, latticeTestnet];
     + export const supportedChains: MUDChain[] = [mudFoundry, latticeTestnet];
     ```

  3. In `getNetworkConfig.ts`, remove the return type (to let TS infer it for now), remove now-unused config values, and add the viem `chain` object.

     ```diff
     - export async function getNetworkConfig(): Promise<NetworkConfig> {
     + export async function getNetworkConfig() {
     ```

     ```diff
       const initialBlockNumber = params.has("initialBlockNumber")
         ? Number(params.get("initialBlockNumber"))
     -   : world?.blockNumber ?? -1; // -1 will attempt to find the block number from RPC
     +   : world?.blockNumber ?? 0n;
     ```

     ```diff
     + return {
     +   privateKey: getBurnerWallet().value,
     +   chain,
     +   worldAddress,
     +   initialBlockNumber,
     +   faucetServiceUrl: params.get("faucet") ?? chain.faucetUrl,
     + };
     ```

  4. In `setupNetwork.ts`, replace `setupMUDV2Network` with `syncToRecs`.

     ```diff
     - import { setupMUDV2Network } from "@latticexyz/std-client";
     - import { createFastTxExecutor, createFaucetService, getSnapSyncRecords } from "@latticexyz/network";
     + import { createFaucetService } from "@latticexyz/network";
     + import { createPublicClient, fallback, webSocket, http, createWalletClient, getContract, Hex, parseEther, ClientConfig } from "viem";
     + import { encodeEntity, syncToRecs } from "@latticexyz/store-sync/recs";
     + import { createBurnerAccount, createContract, transportObserver } from "@latticexyz/common";
     ```

     ```diff
     - const result = await setupMUDV2Network({
     -   ...
     - });

     + const clientOptions = {
     +   chain: networkConfig.chain,
     +   transport: transportObserver(fallback([webSocket(), http()])),
     +   pollingInterval: 1000,
     + } as const satisfies ClientConfig;

     + const publicClient = createPublicClient(clientOptions);

     + const burnerAccount = createBurnerAccount(networkConfig.privateKey as Hex);
     + const burnerWalletClient = createWalletClient({
     +   ...clientOptions,
     +   account: burnerAccount,
     + });

     + const { components, latestBlock$, blockStorageOperations$, waitForTransaction } = await syncToRecs({
     +   world,
     +   config: storeConfig,
     +   address: networkConfig.worldAddress as Hex,
     +   publicClient,
     +   components: contractComponents,
     +   startBlock: BigInt(networkConfig.initialBlockNumber),
     +   indexerUrl: networkConfig.indexerUrl ?? undefined,
     + });

     + const worldContract = createContract({
     +   address: networkConfig.worldAddress as Hex,
     +   abi: IWorld__factory.abi,
     +   publicClient,
     +   walletClient: burnerWalletClient,
     + });
     ```

     ```diff
       // Request drip from faucet
     - const signer = result.network.signer.get();
     - if (networkConfig.faucetServiceUrl && signer) {
     -   const address = await signer.getAddress();
     + if (networkConfig.faucetServiceUrl) {
     +   const address = burnerAccount.address;
     ```

     ```diff
       const requestDrip = async () => {
     -   const balance = await signer.getBalance();
     +   const balance = await publicClient.getBalance({ address });
         console.info(`[Dev Faucet]: Player balance -> ${balance}`);
     -   const lowBalance = balance?.lte(utils.parseEther("1"));
     +   const lowBalance = balance < parseEther("1");
     ```

     You can remove the previous ethers `worldContract`, snap sync code, and fast transaction executor.

     The return of `setupNetwork` is a bit different than before, so you may have to do corresponding app changes.

     ```diff
     + return {
     +   world,
     +   components,
     +   playerEntity: encodeEntity({ address: "address" }, { address: burnerWalletClient.account.address }),
     +   publicClient,
     +   walletClient: burnerWalletClient,
     +   latestBlock$,
     +   blockStorageOperations$,
     +   waitForTransaction,
     +   worldContract,
     + };
     ```

  5. Update `createSystemCalls` with the new return type of `setupNetwork`.

     ```diff
       export function createSystemCalls(
     -   { worldSend, txReduced$, singletonEntity }: SetupNetworkResult,
     +   { worldContract, waitForTransaction }: SetupNetworkResult,
         { Counter }: ClientComponents
       ) {
          const increment = async () => {
     -      const tx = await worldSend("increment", []);
     -      await awaitStreamValue(txReduced$, (txHash) => txHash === tx.hash);
     +      const tx = await worldContract.write.increment();
     +      await waitForTransaction(tx);
            return getComponentValue(Counter, singletonEntity);
          };
     ```

  6. (optional) If you still need a clock, you can create it with:

     ```ts
     import { map, filter } from "rxjs";
     import { createClock } from "@latticexyz/network";

     const clock = createClock({
       period: 1000,
       initialTime: 0,
       syncInterval: 5000,
     });

     world.registerDisposer(() => clock.dispose());

     latestBlock$
       .pipe(
         map((block) => Number(block.timestamp) * 1000), // Map to timestamp in ms
         filter((blockTimestamp) => blockTimestamp !== clock.lastUpdateTime), // Ignore if the clock was already refreshed with this block
         filter((blockTimestamp) => blockTimestamp !== clock.currentTime) // Ignore if the current local timestamp is correct
       )
       .subscribe(clock.update); // Update the local clock
     ```

  If you're using the previous `LoadingState` component, you'll want to migrate to the new `SyncProgress`:

  ```ts
  import { SyncStep, singletonEntity } from "@latticexyz/store-sync/recs";

  const syncProgress = useComponentValue(SyncProgress, singletonEntity, {
    message: "Connecting",
    percentage: 0,
    step: SyncStep.INITIALIZE,
  });

  if (syncProgress.step === SyncStep.LIVE) {
    // we're live!
  }
  ```

- [#1261](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1261) [`cd5abcc3`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/cd5abcc3b4744fab9a45c322bc76ff013355ffcb) Thanks [@holic](https://github.com/holic)! - Add utils for using viem with MUD

  - `createContract` is a wrapper around [viem's `getContract`](https://viem.sh/docs/contract/getContract.html) but with better nonce handling for faster executing of transactions. It has the same arguments and return type as `getContract`.
  - `createNonceManager` helps track local nonces, used by `createContract`.

  Also renames `mudTransportObserver` to `transportObserver`.

### Minor Changes

- [#1245](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1245) [`3fb9ce28`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/3fb9ce2839271a0dcfe97f86394195f7a6f70f50) Thanks [@holic](https://github.com/holic)! - Add utils for using viem with MUD

  - `mudFoundry` chain with a transaction request formatter that temporarily removes max fees to work better with anvil `--base-fee 0`
  - `createBurnerAccount` that also temporarily removes max fees during transaction signing to work better with anvil `--base-fee 0`
  - `mudTransportObserver` that will soon let MUD Dev Tools observe transactions

  You can use them like:

  ```ts
  import { createBurnerAccount, mudTransportObserver } from "@latticexyz/common";
  import { mudFoundry } from "@latticexyz/common/chains";

  createWalletClient({
    account: createBurnerAccount(privateKey),
    chain: mudFoundry,
    transport: mudTransportObserver(http()),
    pollingInterval: 1000,
  });
  ```

### Minor Changes

- [#1173](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1173) [`0c4f9fea`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/0c4f9fea9e38ba122316cdd52c3d158c62f8cfee) Thanks [@holic](https://github.com/holic)! - `TableId.toHex()` now truncates name/namespace to 16 bytes each, to properly fit into a `bytes32` hex string.

  Also adds a few utils we'll need in the indexer:

  - `bigIntMin` is similar to `Math.min` but for `bigint`s
  - `bigIntMax` is similar to `Math.max` but for `bigint`s
  - `bigIntSort` for sorting an array of `bigint`s
  - `chunk` to split an array into chunks
  - `wait` returns a `Promise` that resolves after specified number of milliseconds
