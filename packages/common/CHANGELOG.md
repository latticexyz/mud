# Change Log

## 2.0.5

### Patch Changes

- a9e8a407: Fixed `getNonceManager` to correctly pass all options to `createNonceManager`.
  - @latticexyz/schema-type@2.0.5

## 2.0.4

### Patch Changes

- 620e4ec1: `transactionQueue` now accepts a `queueConcurrency` to allow adjusting the number of concurrent calls to the mempool. This defaults to `1` to ensure transactions are ordered and nonces are handled properly. Any number greater than that is likely to see nonce errors and transactions arriving out of order, but this may be an acceptable trade-off for some applications that can safely retry.
  - @latticexyz/schema-type@2.0.4

## 2.0.3

### Patch Changes

- d2e4d0fb: `transactionQueue` decorator now accepts an optional `publicClient` argument, which will be used in place of the extended viem client for making public action calls (`getChainId`, `getTransactionCount`, `simulateContract`, `call`). This helps in cases where the extended viem client is a smart account client, like in [permissionless.js](https://github.com/pimlicolabs/permissionless.js), where the transport is the bundler, not an RPC.

  `writeObserver` decorator now accepts any `Client`, not just a `WalletClient`.

  `createBurnerAccount` now returns a `PrivateKeyAccount`, the more specific `Account` type.

  - @latticexyz/schema-type@2.0.3

## 2.0.2

### Patch Changes

- @latticexyz/schema-type@2.0.2

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- @latticexyz/schema-type@2.0.1

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 65c9546c4: - Add `renderWithFieldSuffix` helper method to always render a field function with a suffix, and optionally render the same function without a suffix.
  - Remove `methodNameSuffix` from `RenderField` interface, because the suffix is now computed as part of `renderWithFieldSuffix`.
- 44236041f: Moved table ID and field layout constants in code-generated table libraries from the file level into the library, for clearer access and cleaner imports.

  ```diff
  -import { SomeTable, SomeTableTableId } from "./codegen/tables/SomeTable.sol";
  +import { SomeTable } from "./codegen/tables/SomeTable.sol";

  -console.log(SomeTableTableId);
  +console.log(SomeTable._tableId);

  -console.log(SomeTable.getFieldLayout());
  +console.log(SomeTable._fieldLayout);
  ```

- bfcb293d1: What used to be known as `ephemeral` table is now called `offchain` table.
  The previous `ephemeral` tables only supported an `emitEphemeral` method, which emitted a `StoreSetEphemeralRecord` event.

  Now `offchain` tables support all regular table methods, except partial operations on dynamic fields (`push`, `pop`, `update`).
  Unlike regular tables they don't store data on-chain but emit the same events as regular tables (`StoreSetRecord`, `StoreSpliceStaticData`, `StoreDeleteRecord`), so their data can be indexed by offchain indexers/clients.

  ```diff
  - EphemeralTable.emitEphemeral(value);
  + OffchainTable.set(value);
  ```

- 5e723b90e: - `ResourceSelector` is replaced with `ResourceId`, `ResourceIdLib`, `ResourceIdInstance`, `WorldResourceIdLib` and `WorldResourceIdInstance`.

  Previously a "resource selector" was a `bytes32` value with the first 16 bytes reserved for the resource's namespace, and the last 16 bytes reserved for the resource's name.
  Now a "resource ID" is a `bytes32` value with the first 2 bytes reserved for the resource type, the next 14 bytes reserved for the resource's namespace, and the last 16 bytes reserved for the resource's name.

  Previously `ResouceSelector` was a library and the resource selector type was a plain `bytes32`.
  Now `ResourceId` is a user type, and the functionality is implemented in the `ResourceIdInstance` (for type) and `WorldResourceIdInstance` (for namespace and name) libraries.
  We split the logic into two libraries, because `Store` now also uses `ResourceId` and needs to be aware of resource types, but not of namespaces/names.

  ```diff
  - import { ResourceSelector } from "@latticexyz/world/src/ResourceSelector.sol";
  + import { ResourceId, ResourceIdInstance } from "@latticexyz/store/src/ResourceId.sol";
  + import { WorldResourceIdLib, WorldResourceIdInstance } from "@latticexyz/world/src/WorldResourceId.sol";
  + import { RESOURCE_SYSTEM } from "@latticexyz/world/src/worldResourceTypes.sol";

  - bytes32 systemId = ResourceSelector.from("namespace", "name");
  + ResourceId systemId = WorldResourceIdLib.encode(RESOURCE_SYSTEM, "namespace", "name");

  - using ResourceSelector for bytes32;
  + using WorldResourceIdInstance for ResourceId;
  + using ResourceIdInstance for ResourceId;

    systemId.getName();
    systemId.getNamespace();
  + systemId.getType();

  ```

  - All `Store` and `World` methods now use the `ResourceId` type for `tableId`, `systemId`, `moduleId` and `namespaceId`.
    All mentions of `resourceSelector` were renamed to `resourceId` or the more specific type (e.g. `tableId`, `systemId`)

    ```diff
    import { ResourceId } from "@latticexyz/store/src/ResourceId.sol";

    IStore {
      function setRecord(
    -   bytes32 tableId,
    +   ResourceId tableId,
        bytes32[] calldata keyTuple,
        bytes calldata staticData,
        PackedCounter encodedLengths,
        bytes calldata dynamicData,
        FieldLayout fieldLayout
      ) external;

      // Same for all other methods
    }
    ```

    ```diff
    import { ResourceId } from "@latticexyz/store/src/ResourceId.sol";

    IBaseWorld {
      function callFrom(
        address delegator,
    -   bytes32 resourceSelector,
    +   ResourceId systemId,
        bytes memory callData
      ) external payable returns (bytes memory);

      // Same for all other methods
    }
    ```

- 60cfd089f: Templates and examples now use MUD's new sync packages, all built on top of [viem](https://viem.sh/). This greatly speeds up and stabilizes our networking code and improves types throughout.

  These new sync packages come with support for our `recs` package, including `encodeEntity` and `decodeEntity` utilities for composite keys.

  If you're using `store-cache` and `useRow`/`useRows`, you should wait to upgrade until we have a suitable replacement for those libraries. We're working on a [sql.js](https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js/)-powered sync module that will replace `store-cache`.

  **Migrate existing RECS apps to new sync packages**

  As you migrate, you may find some features replaced, removed, or not included by default. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/issues/new) and let us know if we missed anything.

  1. Add `@latticexyz/store-sync` package to your app's `client` package and make sure `viem` is pinned to version `1.3.1` (otherwise you may get type errors)
  2. In your `supportedChains.ts`, replace `foundry` chain with our new `mudFoundry` chain.

     ```diff
     - import { foundry } from "viem/chains";
     - import { MUDChain, latticeTestnet } from "@latticexyz/common/chains";
     + import { MUDChain, latticeTestnet, mudFoundry } from "@latticexyz/common/chains";

     - export const supportedChains: MUDChain[] = [foundry, latticeTestnet];
     + export const supportedChains: MUDChain[] = [mudFoundry, latticeTestnet];
     ```

  3. In `getNetworkConfig.ts`, remove the return type (to let TS infer it for now), remove now-unused config values, and add the viem `chain` object.

     ```diff
     - export async function getNetworkConfig(): Promise<NetworkConfig> {
     + export async function getNetworkConfig() {
     ```

     ```diff
       const initialBlockNumber = params.has("initialBlockNumber")
         ? Number(params.get("initialBlockNumber"))
     -   : world?.blockNumber ?? -1; // -1 will attempt to find the block number from RPC
     +   : world?.blockNumber ?? 0n;
     ```

     ```diff
     + return {
     +   privateKey: getBurnerWallet().value,
     +   chain,
     +   worldAddress,
     +   initialBlockNumber,
     +   faucetServiceUrl: params.get("faucet") ?? chain.faucetUrl,
     + };
     ```

  4. In `setupNetwork.ts`, replace `setupMUDV2Network` with `syncToRecs`.

     ```diff
     - import { setupMUDV2Network } from "@latticexyz/std-client";
     - import { createFastTxExecutor, createFaucetService, getSnapSyncRecords } from "@latticexyz/network";
     + import { createFaucetService } from "@latticexyz/network";
     + import { createPublicClient, fallback, webSocket, http, createWalletClient, getContract, Hex, parseEther, ClientConfig } from "viem";
     + import { encodeEntity, syncToRecs } from "@latticexyz/store-sync/recs";
     + import { createBurnerAccount, createContract, transportObserver } from "@latticexyz/common";
     ```

     ```diff
     - const result = await setupMUDV2Network({
     -   ...
     - });

     + const clientOptions = {
     +   chain: networkConfig.chain,
     +   transport: transportObserver(fallback([webSocket(), http()])),
     +   pollingInterval: 1000,
     + } as const satisfies ClientConfig;

     + const publicClient = createPublicClient(clientOptions);

     + const burnerAccount = createBurnerAccount(networkConfig.privateKey as Hex);
     + const burnerWalletClient = createWalletClient({
     +   ...clientOptions,
     +   account: burnerAccount,
     + });

     + const { components, latestBlock$, blockStorageOperations$, waitForTransaction } = await syncToRecs({
     +   world,
     +   config: storeConfig,
     +   address: networkConfig.worldAddress as Hex,
     +   publicClient,
     +   components: contractComponents,
     +   startBlock: BigInt(networkConfig.initialBlockNumber),
     +   indexerUrl: networkConfig.indexerUrl ?? undefined,
     + });

     + const worldContract = createContract({
     +   address: networkConfig.worldAddress as Hex,
     +   abi: IWorld__factory.abi,
     +   publicClient,
     +   walletClient: burnerWalletClient,
     + });
     ```

     ```diff
       // Request drip from faucet
     - const signer = result.network.signer.get();
     - if (networkConfig.faucetServiceUrl && signer) {
     -   const address = await signer.getAddress();
     + if (networkConfig.faucetServiceUrl) {
     +   const address = burnerAccount.address;
     ```

     ```diff
       const requestDrip = async () => {
     -   const balance = await signer.getBalance();
     +   const balance = await publicClient.getBalance({ address });
         console.info(`[Dev Faucet]: Player balance -> ${balance}`);
     -   const lowBalance = balance?.lte(utils.parseEther("1"));
     +   const lowBalance = balance < parseEther("1");
     ```

     You can remove the previous ethers `worldContract`, snap sync code, and fast transaction executor.

     The return of `setupNetwork` is a bit different than before, so you may have to do corresponding app changes.

     ```diff
     + return {
     +   world,
     +   components,
     +   playerEntity: encodeEntity({ address: "address" }, { address: burnerWalletClient.account.address }),
     +   publicClient,
     +   walletClient: burnerWalletClient,
     +   latestBlock$,
     +   blockStorageOperations$,
     +   waitForTransaction,
     +   worldContract,
     + };
     ```

  5. Update `createSystemCalls` with the new return type of `setupNetwork`.

     ```diff
       export function createSystemCalls(
     -   { worldSend, txReduced$, singletonEntity }: SetupNetworkResult,
     +   { worldContract, waitForTransaction }: SetupNetworkResult,
         { Counter }: ClientComponents
       ) {
          const increment = async () => {
     -      const tx = await worldSend("increment", []);
     -      await awaitStreamValue(txReduced$, (txHash) => txHash === tx.hash);
     +      const tx = await worldContract.write.increment();
     +      await waitForTransaction(tx);
            return getComponentValue(Counter, singletonEntity);
          };
     ```

  6. (optional) If you still need a clock, you can create it with:

     ```ts
     import { map, filter } from "rxjs";
     import { createClock } from "@latticexyz/network";

     const clock = createClock({
       period: 1000,
       initialTime: 0,
       syncInterval: 5000,
     });

     world.registerDisposer(() => clock.dispose());

     latestBlock$
       .pipe(
         map((block) => Number(block.timestamp) * 1000), // Map to timestamp in ms
         filter((blockTimestamp) => blockTimestamp !== clock.lastUpdateTime), // Ignore if the clock was already refreshed with this block
         filter((blockTimestamp) => blockTimestamp !== clock.currentTime), // Ignore if the current local timestamp is correct
       )
       .subscribe(clock.update); // Update the local clock
     ```

  If you're using the previous `LoadingState` component, you'll want to migrate to the new `SyncProgress`:

  ```ts
  import { SyncStep, singletonEntity } from "@latticexyz/store-sync/recs";

  const syncProgress = useComponentValue(SyncProgress, singletonEntity, {
    message: "Connecting",
    percentage: 0,
    step: SyncStep.INITIALIZE,
  });

  if (syncProgress.step === SyncStep.LIVE) {
    // we're live!
  }
  ```

- 6c6733256: Add `tableIdToHex` and `hexToTableId` pure functions and move/deprecate `TableId`.
- cd5abcc3b: Add utils for using viem with MUD

  - `createContract` is a wrapper around [viem's `getContract`](https://viem.sh/docs/contract/getContract.html) but with better nonce handling for faster executing of transactions. It has the same arguments and return type as `getContract`.
  - `createNonceManager` helps track local nonces, used by `createContract`.

  Also renames `mudTransportObserver` to `transportObserver`.

### Minor Changes

- aabd30767: Bumped Solidity version to 0.8.24.
- 331dbfdcb: `readHex` was moved from `@latticexyz/protocol-parser` to `@latticexyz/common`
- 066056154: - Added a `sendTransaction` helper to mirror viem's `sendTransaction`, but with our nonce manager
  - Added an internal mempool queue to `sendTransaction` and `writeContract` for better nonce handling
  - Defaults block tag to `pending` for transaction simulation and transaction count (when initializing the nonce manager)
- 3fb9ce283: Add utils for using viem with MUD

  - `mudFoundry` chain with a transaction request formatter that temporarily removes max fees to work better with anvil `--base-fee 0`
  - `createBurnerAccount` that also temporarily removes max fees during transaction signing to work better with anvil `--base-fee 0`
  - `mudTransportObserver` that will soon let MUD Dev Tools observe transactions

  You can use them like:

  ```ts
  import { createBurnerAccount, mudTransportObserver } from "@latticexyz/common";
  import { mudFoundry } from "@latticexyz/common/chains";

  createWalletClient({
    account: createBurnerAccount(privateKey),
    chain: mudFoundry,
    transport: mudTransportObserver(http()),
    pollingInterval: 1000,
  });
  ```

- 939916bcd: `createContract` now has an `onWrite` callback so you can observe writes. This is useful for wiring up the transanction log in MUD dev tools.

  ```ts
  import { createContract, ContractWrite } from "@latticexyz/common";
  import { Subject } from "rxjs";

  const write$ = new Subject<ContractWrite>();
  creactContract({
    ...
    onWrite: (write) => write$.next(write),
  });
  ```

- b8a6158d6: - adds `defaultPriorityFee` to `mudFoundry` for better support with MUD's default anvil config and removes workaround in `createContract`
  - improves nonce error detection using viem's custom errors
- 59267655: Added viem custom client actions that work the same as MUD's now-deprecated `getContract`, `writeContract`, and `sendTransaction` wrappers. Templates have been updated to reflect the new patterns.

  You can migrate your own code like this:

  ```diff
  -import { createWalletClient } from "viem";
  -import { getContract, writeContract, sendTransaction } from "@latticexyz/common";
  +import { createWalletClient, getContract } from "viem";
  +import { transactionQueue, writeObserver } from "@latticexyz/common/actions";

  -const walletClient = createWalletClient(...);
  +const walletClient = createWalletClient(...)
  +  .extend(transactionQueue())
  +  .extend(writeObserver({ onWrite });

   const worldContract = getContract({
     client: { publicClient, walletClient },
  -  onWrite,
   });
  ```

- 1b5eb0d07: Added `unique` and `groupBy` array helpers to `@latticexyz/common/utils`.

  ```ts
  import { unique } from "@latticexyz/common/utils";

  unique([1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2]);
  // [1, 2, 4, 3]
  ```

  ```ts
  import { groupBy } from "@latticexyz/common/utils";

  const records = [
    { type: "cat", name: "Bob" },
    { type: "cat", name: "Spot" },
    { type: "dog", name: "Rover" },
  ];
  Object.fromEntries(groupBy(records, (record) => record.type));
  // {
  //   "cat": [{ type: "cat", name: "Bob" }, { type: "cat", name: "Spot" }],
  //   "dog: [{ type: "dog", name: "Rover" }]
  // }
  ```

- 44a5432ac: - Add `getRemappings` to get foundry remappings as an array of `[to, from]` tuples.
  - Add `extractUserTypes` solidity parser utility to extract user-defined types.
  - Add `loadAndExtractUserTypes` helper to load and parse a solidity file, extracting user-defined types.
- d075f82f3: - Moves contract write logic out of `createContract` into its own `writeContract` method so that it can be used outside of the contract instance, and for consistency with viem.

  - Deprecates `createContract` in favor of `getContract` for consistency with viem.
  - Reworks `createNonceManager`'s `BroadcastChannel` setup and moves out the notion of a "nonce manager ID" to `getNonceManagerId` so we can create an internal cache with `getNonceManager` for use in `writeContract`.

  If you were using the `createNonceManager` before, you'll just need to rename `publicClient` argument to `client`:

  ```diff
    const publicClient = createPublicClient({ ... });
  - const nonceManager = createNonceManager({ publicClient, ... });
  + const nonceManager = createNonceManager({ client: publicClient, ... });
  ```

- 331dbfdcb: `spliceHex` was added, which has a similar API as JavaScript's [`Array.prototype.splice`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice), but for `Hex` strings.

  ```ts
  spliceHex("0x123456", 1, 1, "0x0000"); // "0x12000056"
  ```

- 92de59982: Bump Solidity version to 0.8.21
- 0c4f9fea9: `TableId.toHex()` now truncates name/namespace to 16 bytes each, to properly fit into a `bytes32` hex string.

  Also adds a few utils we'll need in the indexer:

  - `bigIntMin` is similar to `Math.min` but for `bigint`s
  - `bigIntMax` is similar to `Math.max` but for `bigint`s
  - `bigIntSort` for sorting an array of `bigint`s
  - `chunk` to split an array into chunks
  - `wait` returns a `Promise` that resolves after specified number of milliseconds

- 708b49c50: Generated table libraries now have a set of functions prefixed with `_` that always use their own storage for read/write.
  This saves gas for use cases where the functionality to dynamically determine which `Store` to use for read/write is not needed, e.g. root systems in a `World`, or when using `Store` without `World`.

  We decided to continue to always generate a set of functions that dynamically decide which `Store` to use, so that the generated table libraries can still be imported by non-root systems.

  ```solidity
  library Counter {
    // Dynamically determine which store to write to based on the context
    function set(uint32 value) internal;

    // Always write to own storage
    function _set(uint32 value) internal;

    // ... equivalent functions for all other Store methods
  }
  ```

- d2f8e9400: Renames `resourceIdToHex` to `resourceToHex` and `hexToResourceId` to `hexToResource`, to better distinguish between a resource ID (hex value) and a resource reference (type, namespace, name).

  ```diff
  - resourceIdToHex({ type: 'table', namespace: '', name: 'Position' });
  + resourceToHex({ type: 'table', namespace: '', name: 'Position' });
  ```

  ```diff
  - hexToResourceId('0x...');
  + hexToResource('0x...');
  ```

  Previous methods still exist but are now deprecated to ease migration and reduce breaking changes. These will be removed in a future version.

  Also removes the previously deprecated and unused table ID utils (replaced by these resource ID utils).

- b1d41727d: Added a `mapObject` helper to map the value of each property of an object to a new value.
- 4c1dcd81e: - Added a `Result<Ok, Err>` type for more explicit and typesafe error handling ([inspired by Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/)).

  - Added a `includes` util as typesafe alternative to [`Array.prototype.includes()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/includes).

- 6071163f7: - Moves zero gas fee override to `createContract` until https://github.com/wagmi-dev/viem/pull/963 or similar feature lands
  - Skip simulation if `gas` is provided
- d7b1c588a: Upgraded all packages and templates to viem v2.7.12 and abitype v1.0.0.

  Some viem APIs have changed and we've updated `getContract` to reflect those changes and keep it aligned with viem. It's one small code change:

  ```diff
   const worldContract = getContract({
     address: worldAddress,
     abi: IWorldAbi,
  -  publicClient,
  -  walletClient,
  +  client: { public: publicClient, wallet: walletClient },
   });
  ```

- 5df1f31bc: Updated `chunk` types to use readonly arrays
- cea754dde: - The external `setRecord` and `deleteRecord` methods of `IStore` no longer accept a `FieldLayout` as input, but load it from storage instead.
  This is to prevent invalid `FieldLayout` values being passed, which could cause the onchain state to diverge from the indexer state.
  However, the internal `StoreCore` library still exposes a `setRecord` and `deleteRecord` method that allows a `FieldLayout` to be passed.
  This is because `StoreCore` can only be used internally, so the `FieldLayout` value can be trusted and we can save the gas for accessing storage.

  ```diff
  interface IStore {
    function setRecord(
      ResourceId tableId,
      bytes32[] calldata keyTuple,
      bytes calldata staticData,
      PackedCounter encodedLengths,
      bytes calldata dynamicData,
  -   FieldLayout fieldLayout
    ) external;

    function deleteRecord(
      ResourceId tableId,
      bytes32[] memory keyTuple,
  -   FieldLayout fieldLayout
    ) external;
  }
  ```

  - The `spliceStaticData` method and `Store_SpliceStaticData` event of `IStore` and `StoreCore` no longer include `deleteCount` in their signature.
    This is because when splicing static data, the data after `start` is always overwritten with `data` instead of being shifted, so `deleteCount` is always the length of the data to be written.

    ```diff

    event Store_SpliceStaticData(
      ResourceId indexed tableId,
      bytes32[] keyTuple,
      uint48 start,
    - uint40 deleteCount,
      bytes data
    );

    interface IStore {
      function spliceStaticData(
        ResourceId tableId,
        bytes32[] calldata keyTuple,
        uint48 start,
    -   uint40 deleteCount,
        bytes calldata data
      ) external;
    }
    ```

  - The `updateInField` method has been removed from `IStore`, as it's almost identical to the more general `spliceDynamicData`.
    If you're manually calling `updateInField`, here is how to upgrade to `spliceDynamicData`:

    ```diff
    - store.updateInField(tableId, keyTuple, fieldIndex, startByteIndex, dataToSet, fieldLayout);
    + uint8 dynamicFieldIndex = fieldIndex - fieldLayout.numStaticFields();
    + store.spliceDynamicData(tableId, keyTuple, dynamicFieldIndex, uint40(startByteIndex), uint40(dataToSet.length), dataToSet);
    ```

  - All other methods that are only valid for dynamic fields (`pushToField`, `popFromField`, `getFieldSlice`)
    have been renamed to make this more explicit (`pushToDynamicField`, `popFromDynamicField`, `getDynamicFieldSlice`).

    Their `fieldIndex` parameter has been replaced by a `dynamicFieldIndex` parameter, which is the index relative to the first dynamic field (i.e. `dynamicFieldIndex` = `fieldIndex` - `numStaticFields`).
    The `FieldLayout` parameter has been removed, as it was only used to calculate the `dynamicFieldIndex` in the method.

    ```diff
    interface IStore {
    - function pushToField(
    + function pushToDynamicField(
        ResourceId tableId,
        bytes32[] calldata keyTuple,
    -   uint8 fieldIndex,
    +   uint8 dynamicFieldIndex,
        bytes calldata dataToPush,
    -   FieldLayout fieldLayout
      ) external;

    - function popFromField(
    + function popFromDynamicField(
        ResourceId tableId,
        bytes32[] calldata keyTuple,
    -   uint8 fieldIndex,
    +   uint8 dynamicFieldIndex,
        uint256 byteLengthToPop,
    -   FieldLayout fieldLayout
      ) external;

    - function getFieldSlice(
    + function getDynamicFieldSlice(
        ResourceId tableId,
        bytes32[] memory keyTuple,
    -   uint8 fieldIndex,
    +   uint8 dynamicFieldIndex,
    -   FieldLayout fieldLayout,
        uint256 start,
        uint256 end
      ) external view returns (bytes memory data);
    }
    ```

  - `IStore` has a new `getDynamicFieldLength` length method, which returns the byte length of the given dynamic field and doesn't require the `FieldLayout`.

    ```diff
    IStore {
    + function getDynamicFieldLength(
    +   ResourceId tableId,
    +   bytes32[] memory keyTuple,
    +   uint8 dynamicFieldIndex
    + ) external view returns (uint256);
    }

    ```

  - `IStore` now has additional overloads for `getRecord`, `getField`, `getFieldLength` and `setField` that don't require a `FieldLength` to be passed, but instead load it from storage.
  - `IStore` now exposes `setStaticField` and `setDynamicField` to save gas by avoiding the dynamic inference of whether the field is static or dynamic.
  - The `getDynamicFieldSlice` method no longer accepts reading outside the bounds of the dynamic field.
    This is to avoid returning invalid data, as the data of a dynamic field is not deleted when the record is deleted, but only its length is set to zero.

- 331f0d636: Deprecate `@latticexyz/std-client` and remove v1 network dependencies.

  - `getBurnerWallet` is replaced by `getBurnerPrivateKey` from `@latticexyz/common`. It now returns a `Hex` string instead of an `rxjs` `BehaviorSubject`.

    ```
    - import { getBurnerWallet } from "@latticexyz/std-client";
    + import { getBurnerPrivateKey } from "@latticexyz/common";

    - const privateKey = getBurnerWallet().value;
    - const privateKey = getBurnerPrivateKey();
    ```

  - All functions from `std-client` that depended on v1 network code are removed (most notably `setupMUDNetwork` and `setupMUDV2Network`). Consumers should upgrade to v2 networking code from `@latticexyz/store-sync`.
  - The following functions are removed from `std-client` because they are very use-case specific and depend on deprecated code: `getCurrentTurn`, `getTurnAtTime`, `getGameConfig`, `isUntraversable`, `getPlayerEntity`, `resolveRelationshipChain`, `findEntityWithComponentInRelationshipChain`, `findInRelationshipChain`. Consumers should vendor these functions if they are still needed.
  - Remaining exports from `std-client` are moved to `/deprecated`. The package will be removed in a future release (once there are replacements for the deprecated exports).

    ```diff
    - import { ... } from "@latticexyz/std-client";
    + import { ... } from "@latticexyz/std-client/deprecated";
    ```

### Patch Changes

- a35c05ea9: Table libraries now hardcode the `bytes32` table ID value rather than computing it in Solidity. This saves a bit of gas across all storage operations.
- 16b13ea8f: Adds viem workaround for zero base fee used by MUD's anvil config
- 82693072: `waitForIdle` now falls back to `setTimeout` for environments without `requestIdleCallback`.
- d5c0682fb: Updated all human-readable resource IDs to use `{namespace}__{name}` for consistency with world function signatures.
- 01e46d99: Removed some unused files, namely `curry` in `@latticexyz/common` and `useDeprecatedComputedValue` from `@latticexyz/react`.
- bb6ada740: Initial sync from indexer no longer blocks the promise returning from `createStoreSync`, `syncToRecs`, and `syncToSqlite`. This should help with rendering loading screens using the `SyncProgress` RECS component and avoid the long flashes of no content in templates.

  By default, `syncToRecs` and `syncToSqlite` will start syncing (via observable subscription) immediately after called.

  If your app needs to control when syncing starts, you can use the `startSync: false` option and then `blockStoreOperations$.subscribe()` to start the sync yourself. Just be sure to unsubscribe to avoid memory leaks.

  ```ts
  const { blockStorageOperations$ } = syncToRecs({
    ...
    startSync: false,
  });

  // start sync manually by subscribing to `blockStorageOperation# Change Log
  const subcription = blockStorageOperation$.subscribe();

  // clean up subscription
  subscription.unsubscribe();
  ```

- 35c9f33df: - Remove need for tx queue in `createContract`

## 2.0.0-next.18

### Major Changes

- 44236041: Moved table ID and field layout constants in code-generated table libraries from the file level into the library, for clearer access and cleaner imports.

  ```diff
  -import { SomeTable, SomeTableTableId } from "./codegen/tables/SomeTable.sol";
  +import { SomeTable } from "./codegen/tables/SomeTable.sol";

  -console.log(SomeTableTableId);
  +console.log(SomeTable._tableId);

  -console.log(SomeTable.getFieldLayout());
  +console.log(SomeTable._fieldLayout);
  ```

### Minor Changes

- 59267655: Added viem custom client actions that work the same as MUD's now-deprecated `getContract`, `writeContract`, and `sendTransaction` wrappers. Templates have been updated to reflect the new patterns.

  You can migrate your own code like this:

  ```diff
  -import { createWalletClient } from "viem";
  -import { getContract, writeContract, sendTransaction } from "@latticexyz/common";
  +import { createWalletClient, getContract } from "viem";
  +import { transactionQueue, writeObserver } from "@latticexyz/common/actions";

  -const walletClient = createWalletClient(...);
  +const walletClient = createWalletClient(...)
  +  .extend(transactionQueue())
  +  .extend(writeObserver({ onWrite });

   const worldContract = getContract({
     client: { publicClient, walletClient },
  -  onWrite,
   });
  ```

- d7b1c588a: Upgraded all packages and templates to viem v2.7.12 and abitype v1.0.0.

  Some viem APIs have changed and we've updated `getContract` to reflect those changes and keep it aligned with viem. It's one small code change:

  ```diff
   const worldContract = getContract({
     address: worldAddress,
     abi: IWorldAbi,
  -  publicClient,
  -  walletClient,
  +  client: { public: publicClient, wallet: walletClient },
   });
  ```

### Patch Changes

- 01e46d99: Removed some unused files, namely `curry` in `@latticexyz/common` and `useDeprecatedComputedValue` from `@latticexyz/react`.

  ```ts
  import { unique } from "@latticexyz/common/utils";

  unique([1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2]);
  // [1, 2, 4, 3]
  ```

  ```ts

  const records = [
    { type: "cat", name: "Bob" },

  // {
  //   "cat": [{ type: "cat", name: "Bob" }, { type: "cat", name: "Spot" }],
  //   "dog: [{ type: "dog", name: "Rover" }]
  // }
  ```

- 4c1dcd81: - Added a `Result<Ok, Err>` type for more explicit and typesafe error handling ([inspired by Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/)).

  - Added a `includes` util as typesafe alternative to [`Array.prototype.includes()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/includes).

- 5df1f31b: Updated `chunk` types to use readonly arrays

  - @latticexyz/schema-type@2.0.0-next.13

## 2.0.0-next.12

### Minor Changes

- 06605615: - Added a `sendTransaction` helper to mirror viem's `sendTransaction`, but with our nonce manager
  - Added an internal mempool queue to `sendTransaction` and `writeContract` for better nonce handling
  - Defaults block tag to `pending` for transaction simulation and transaction count (when initializing the nonce manager)
- d2f8e940: Renames `resourceIdToHex` to `resourceToHex` and `hexToResourceId` to `hexToResource`, to better distinguish between a resource ID (hex value) and a resource reference (type, namespace, name).

  ```diff
  - resourceIdToHex({ type: 'table', namespace: '', name: 'Position' });
  + resourceToHex({ type: 'table', namespace: '', name: 'Position' });
  ```

  ```diff
  - hexToResourceId('0x...');
  + hexToResource('0x...');
  ```

  Previous methods still exist but are now deprecated to ease migration and reduce breaking changes. These will be removed in a future version.

  Also removes the previously deprecated and unused table ID utils (replaced by these resource ID utils).

### Patch Changes

- f62c767e: Moved some codegen to use `fs/promises` for better parallelism.
- 25086be5: Replaced temporary `.mudtest` file in favor of `WORLD_ADDRESS` environment variable when running tests with `MudTest` contract
  - @latticexyz/schema-type@2.0.0-next.12

## 2.0.0-next.11

### Minor Changes

- d075f82f: - Moves contract write logic out of `createContract` into its own `writeContract` method so that it can be used outside of the contract instance, and for consistency with viem.

  - Deprecates `createContract` in favor of `getContract` for consistency with viem.
  - Reworks `createNonceManager`'s `BroadcastChannel` setup and moves out the notion of a "nonce manager ID" to `getNonceManagerId` so we can create an internal cache with `getNonceManager` for use in `writeContract`.

  If you were using the `createNonceManager` before, you'll just need to rename `publicClient` argument to `client`:

  ```diff
    const publicClient = createPublicClient({ ... });
  - const nonceManager = createNonceManager({ publicClient, ... });
  + const nonceManager = createNonceManager({ client: publicClient, ... });
  ```

### Patch Changes

### Major Changes

- [#1550](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1550) [`65c9546c`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/65c9546c4ee8a410b21d032f02b0050442152e7e) Thanks [@dk1a](https://github.com/dk1a)! - - Add `renderWithFieldSuffix` helper method to always render a field function with a suffix, and optionally render the same function without a suffix.

  - Remove `methodNameSuffix` from `RenderField` interface, because the suffix is now computed as part of `renderWithFieldSuffix`.

- [#1558](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1558) [`bfcb293d`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/bfcb293d1931edde7f8a3e077f6f555a26fd1d2f) Thanks [@alvrs](https://github.com/alvrs)! - What used to be known as `ephemeral` table is now called `offchain` table.
  The previous `ephemeral` tables only supported an `emitEphemeral` method, which emitted a `StoreSetEphemeralRecord` event.

  Now `offchain` tables support all regular table methods, except partial operations on dynamic fields (`push`, `pop`, `update`).
  Unlike regular tables they don't store data on-chain but emit the same events as regular tables (`StoreSetRecord`, `StoreSpliceStaticData`, `StoreDeleteRecord`), so their data can be indexed by offchain indexers/clients.

  ```diff
  - EphemeralTable.emitEphemeral(value);
  + OffchainTable.set(value);
  ```

- [#1544](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1544) [`5e723b90`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/5e723b90e6b18bc70d357ff4b0a1b217611236ae) Thanks [@alvrs](https://github.com/alvrs)! - - `ResourceSelector` is replaced with `ResourceId`, `ResourceIdLib`, `ResourceIdInstance`, `WorldResourceIdLib` and `WorldResourceIdInstance`.

  Previously a "resource selector" was a `bytes32` value with the first 16 bytes reserved for the resource's namespace, and the last 16 bytes reserved for the resource's name.
  Now a "resource ID" is a `bytes32` value with the first 2 bytes reserved for the resource type, the next 14 bytes reserved for the resource's namespace, and the last 16 bytes reserved for the resource's name.

  Previously `ResouceSelector` was a library and the resource selector type was a plain `bytes32`.
  Now `ResourceId` is a user type, and the functionality is implemented in the `ResourceIdInstance` (for type) and `WorldResourceIdInstance` (for namespace and name) libraries.
  We split the logic into two libraries, because `Store` now also uses `ResourceId` and needs to be aware of resource types, but not of namespaces/names.

  ```diff
  - import { ResourceSelector } from "@latticexyz/world/src/ResourceSelector.sol";
  + import { ResourceId, ResourceIdInstance } from "@latticexyz/store/src/ResourceId.sol";
  + import { WorldResourceIdLib, WorldResourceIdInstance } from "@latticexyz/world/src/WorldResourceId.sol";
  + import { RESOURCE_SYSTEM } from "@latticexyz/world/src/worldResourceTypes.sol";

  - bytes32 systemId = ResourceSelector.from("namespace", "name");
  + ResourceId systemId = WorldResourceIdLib.encode(RESOURCE_SYSTEM, "namespace", "name");

  - using ResourceSelector for bytes32;
  + using WorldResourceIdInstance for ResourceId;
  + using ResourceIdInstance for ResourceId;

    systemId.getName();
    systemId.getNamespace();
  + systemId.getType();

  ```

  - All `Store` and `World` methods now use the `ResourceId` type for `tableId`, `systemId`, `moduleId` and `namespaceId`.
    All mentions of `resourceSelector` were renamed to `resourceId` or the more specific type (e.g. `tableId`, `systemId`)

    ```diff
    import { ResourceId } from "@latticexyz/store/src/ResourceId.sol";

    IStore {
      function setRecord(
    -   bytes32 tableId,
    +   ResourceId tableId,
        bytes32[] calldata keyTuple,
        bytes calldata staticData,
        PackedCounter encodedLengths,
        bytes calldata dynamicData,
        FieldLayout fieldLayout
      ) external;

      // Same for all other methods
    }
    ```

    ```diff
    import { ResourceId } from "@latticexyz/store/src/ResourceId.sol";

    IBaseWorld {
      function callFrom(
        address delegator,
    -   bytes32 resourceSelector,
    +   ResourceId systemId,
        bytes memory callData
      ) external payable returns (bytes memory);

      // Same for all other methods
    }
    ```

  ```ts
  spliceHex("0x123456", 1, 1, "0x0000"); // "0x12000056"
  ```

- [#1473](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1473) [`92de5998`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/92de59982fb9fc4e00e50c4a5232ed541f3ce71a) Thanks [@holic](https://github.com/holic)! - Bump Solidity version to 0.8.21

- [#1513](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1513) [`708b49c5`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/708b49c50e05f7b67b596e72ebfcbd76e1ff6280) Thanks [@Boffee](https://github.com/Boffee)! - Generated table libraries now have a set of functions prefixed with `_` that always use their own storage for read/write.
  This saves gas for use cases where the functionality to dynamically determine which `Store` to use for read/write is not needed, e.g. root systems in a `World`, or when using `Store` without `World`.

  We decided to continue to always generate a set of functions that dynamically decide which `Store` to use, so that the generated table libraries can still be imported by non-root systems.

  ```solidity
  library Counter {
    // Dynamically determine which store to write to based on the context
    function set(uint32 value) internal;

    // Always write to own storage
    function _set(uint32 value) internal;

    // ... equivalent functions for all other Store methods
  }
  ```

- [#1581](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1581) [`cea754dd`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/cea754dde0d8abf7392e93faa319b260956ae92b) Thanks [@alvrs](https://github.com/alvrs)! - - The external `setRecord` and `deleteRecord` methods of `IStore` no longer accept a `FieldLayout` as input, but load it from storage instead.
  This is to prevent invalid `FieldLayout` values being passed, which could cause the onchain state to diverge from the indexer state.
  However, the internal `StoreCore` library still exposes a `setRecord` and `deleteRecord` method that allows a `FieldLayout` to be passed.
  This is because `StoreCore` can only be used internally, so the `FieldLayout` value can be trusted and we can save the gas for accessing storage.

  ```diff
  interface IStore {
    function setRecord(
      ResourceId tableId,
      bytes32[] calldata keyTuple,
      bytes calldata staticData,
      PackedCounter encodedLengths,
      bytes calldata dynamicData,
  -   FieldLayout fieldLayout
    ) external;

    function deleteRecord(
      ResourceId tableId,
      bytes32[] memory keyTuple,
  -   FieldLayout fieldLayout
    ) external;
  }
  ```

  - The `spliceStaticData` method and `Store_SpliceStaticData` event of `IStore` and `StoreCore` no longer include `deleteCount` in their signature.
    This is because when splicing static data, the data after `start` is always overwritten with `data` instead of being shifted, so `deleteCount` is always the length of the data to be written.

    ```diff

    event Store_SpliceStaticData(
      ResourceId indexed tableId,
      bytes32[] keyTuple,
      uint48 start,
    - uint40 deleteCount,
      bytes data
    );

    interface IStore {
      function spliceStaticData(
        ResourceId tableId,
        bytes32[] calldata keyTuple,
        uint48 start,
    -   uint40 deleteCount,
        bytes calldata data
      ) external;
    }
    ```

  - The `updateInField` method has been removed from `IStore`, as it's almost identical to the more general `spliceDynamicData`.
    If you're manually calling `updateInField`, here is how to upgrade to `spliceDynamicData`:

    ```diff
    - store.updateInField(tableId, keyTuple, fieldIndex, startByteIndex, dataToSet, fieldLayout);
    + uint8 dynamicFieldIndex = fieldIndex - fieldLayout.numStaticFields();
    + store.spliceDynamicData(tableId, keyTuple, dynamicFieldIndex, uint40(startByteIndex), uint40(dataToSet.length), dataToSet);
    ```

  - All other methods that are only valid for dynamic fields (`pushToField`, `popFromField`, `getFieldSlice`)
    have been renamed to make this more explicit (`pushToDynamicField`, `popFromDynamicField`, `getDynamicFieldSlice`).

    Their `fieldIndex` parameter has been replaced by a `dynamicFieldIndex` parameter, which is the index relative to the first dynamic field (i.e. `dynamicFieldIndex` = `fieldIndex` - `numStaticFields`).
    The `FieldLayout` parameter has been removed, as it was only used to calculate the `dynamicFieldIndex` in the method.

    ```diff
    interface IStore {
    - function pushToField(
    + function pushToDynamicField(
        ResourceId tableId,
        bytes32[] calldata keyTuple,
    -   uint8 fieldIndex,
    +   uint8 dynamicFieldIndex,
        bytes calldata dataToPush,
    -   FieldLayout fieldLayout
      ) external;

    - function popFromField(
    + function popFromDynamicField(
        ResourceId tableId,
        bytes32[] calldata keyTuple,
    -   uint8 fieldIndex,
    +   uint8 dynamicFieldIndex,
        uint256 byteLengthToPop,
    -   FieldLayout fieldLayout
      ) external;

    - function getFieldSlice(
    + function getDynamicFieldSlice(
        ResourceId tableId,
        bytes32[] memory keyTuple,
    -   uint8 fieldIndex,
    +   uint8 dynamicFieldIndex,
    -   FieldLayout fieldLayout,
        uint256 start,
        uint256 end
      ) external view returns (bytes memory data);
    }
    ```

  - `IStore` has a new `getDynamicFieldLength` length method, which returns the byte length of the given dynamic field and doesn't require the `FieldLayout`.

    ```diff
    IStore {
    + function getDynamicFieldLength(
    +   ResourceId tableId,
    +   bytes32[] memory keyTuple,
    +   uint8 dynamicFieldIndex
    + ) external view returns (uint256);
    }

    ```

  - `IStore` now has additional overloads for `getRecord`, `getField`, `getFieldLength` and `setField` that don't require a `FieldLength` to be passed, but instead load it from storage.

  - `IStore` now exposes `setStaticField` and `setDynamicField` to save gas by avoiding the dynamic inference of whether the field is static or dynamic.

  - The `getDynamicFieldSlice` method no longer accepts reading outside the bounds of the dynamic field.
    This is to avoid returning invalid data, as the data of a dynamic field is not deleted when the record is deleted, but only its length is set to zero.

- [#1311](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1311) [`331f0d63`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/331f0d636f6f327824307570a63fb301d9b897d1) Thanks [@alvrs](https://github.com/alvrs)! - Deprecate `@latticexyz/std-client` and remove v1 network dependencies.

  - `getBurnerWallet` is replaced by `getBurnerPrivateKey` from `@latticexyz/common`. It now returns a `Hex` string instead of an `rxjs` `BehaviorSubject`.

    ```
    - import { getBurnerWallet } from "@latticexyz/std-client";
    + import { getBurnerPrivateKey } from "@latticexyz/common";

    - const privateKey = getBurnerWallet().value;
    - const privateKey = getBurnerPrivateKey();
    ```

  - All functions from `std-client` that depended on v1 network code are removed (most notably `setupMUDNetwork` and `setupMUDV2Network`). Consumers should upgrade to v2 networking code from `@latticexyz/store-sync`.

  - The following functions are removed from `std-client` because they are very use-case specific and depend on deprecated code: `getCurrentTurn`, `getTurnAtTime`, `getGameConfig`, `isUntraversable`, `getPlayerEntity`, `resolveRelationshipChain`, `findEntityWithComponentInRelationshipChain`, `findInRelationshipChain`. Consumers should vendor these functions if they are still needed.

  - Remaining exports from `std-client` are moved to `/deprecated`. The package will be removed in a future release (once there are replacements for the deprecated exports).

    ```diff
    - import { ... } from "@latticexyz/std-client";
    + import { ... } from "@latticexyz/std-client/deprecated";
    ```

### Patch Changes

- [#1315](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1315) [`bb6ada74`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/bb6ada74016bdd5fdf83c930008c694f2f62505e) Thanks [@holic](https://github.com/holic)! - Initial sync from indexer no longer blocks the promise returning from `createStoreSync`, `syncToRecs`, and `syncToSqlite`. This should help with rendering loading screens using the `SyncProgress` RECS component and avoid the long flashes of no content in templates.

  By default, `syncToRecs` and `syncToSqlite` will start syncing (via observable subscription) immediately after called.

  If your app needs to control when syncing starts, you can use the `startSync: false` option and then `blockStoreOperations$.subscribe()` to start the sync yourself. Just be sure to unsubscribe to avoid memory leaks.

  ```ts
  const { blockStorageOperations$ } = syncToRecs({
    ...
    startSync: false,
  });

  // start sync manually by subscribing to `blockStorageOperation# Change Log
  const subcription = blockStorageOperation$.subscribe();

  // clean up subscription
  subscription.unsubscribe();
  ```

This is useful for wiring up the transanction log in MUD dev tools.

  ```ts
  import { createContract, ContractWrite } from "@latticexyz/common";
  import { Subject } from "rxjs";

### Major Changes

- [#1214](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1214) [`60cfd089`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/60cfd089fc7a17b98864b631d265f36718df35a9) Thanks [@holic](https://github.com/holic)! - Templates and examples now use MUD's new sync packages, all built on top of [viem](https://viem.sh/). This greatly speeds up and stabilizes our networking code and improves types throughout.

  These new sync packages come with support for our `recs` package, including `encodeEntity` and `decodeEntity` utilities for composite keys.

  If you're using `store-cache` and `useRow`/`useRows`, you should wait to upgrade until we have a suitable replacement for those libraries. We're working on a [sql.js](https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js/)-powered sync module that will replace `store-cache`.

  **Migrate existing RECS apps to new sync packages**

  As you migrate, you may find some features replaced, removed, or not included by default. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/issues/new) and let us know if we missed anything.

  1. Add `@latticexyz/store-sync` package to your app's `client` package and make sure `viem` is pinned to version `1.3.1` (otherwise you may get type errors)

  2. In your `supportedChains.ts`, replace `foundry` chain with our new `mudFoundry` chain.

     ```diff
     - import { foundry } from "viem/chains";
     - import { MUDChain, latticeTestnet } from "@latticexyz/common/chains";
     + import { MUDChain, latticeTestnet, mudFoundry } from "@latticexyz/common/chains";

     - export const supportedChains: MUDChain[] = [foundry, latticeTestnet];
     + export const supportedChains: MUDChain[] = [mudFoundry, latticeTestnet];
     ```

  3. In `getNetworkConfig.ts`, remove the return type (to let TS infer it for now), remove now-unused config values, and add the viem `chain` object.

     ```diff
     - export async function getNetworkConfig(): Promise<NetworkConfig> {
     + export async function getNetworkConfig() {
     ```

     ```diff
       const initialBlockNumber = params.has("initialBlockNumber")
         ? Number(params.get("initialBlockNumber"))
     -   : world?.blockNumber ?? -1; // -1 will attempt to find the block number from RPC
     +   : world?.blockNumber ?? 0n;
     ```

     ```diff
     + return {
     +   privateKey: getBurnerWallet().value,
     +   chain,
     +   worldAddress,
     +   initialBlockNumber,
     +   faucetServiceUrl: params.get("faucet") ?? chain.faucetUrl,
     + };
     ```

  4. In `setupNetwork.ts`, replace `setupMUDV2Network` with `syncToRecs`.

     ```diff
     - import { setupMUDV2Network } from "@latticexyz/std-client";
     - import { createFastTxExecutor, createFaucetService, getSnapSyncRecords } from "@latticexyz/network";
     + import { createFaucetService } from "@latticexyz/network";
     + import { createPublicClient, fallback, webSocket, http, createWalletClient, getContract, Hex, parseEther, ClientConfig } from "viem";
     + import { encodeEntity, syncToRecs } from "@latticexyz/store-sync/recs";
     + import { createBurnerAccount, createContract, transportObserver } from "@latticexyz/common";
     ```

     ```diff
     - const result = await setupMUDV2Network({
     -   ...
     - });

     + const clientOptions = {
     +   chain: networkConfig.chain,
     +   transport: transportObserver(fallback([webSocket(), http()])),
     +   pollingInterval: 1000,
     + } as const satisfies ClientConfig;

     + const publicClient = createPublicClient(clientOptions);

     + const burnerAccount = createBurnerAccount(networkConfig.privateKey as Hex);
     + const burnerWalletClient = createWalletClient({
     +   ...clientOptions,
     +   account: burnerAccount,
     + });

     + const { components, latestBlock$, blockStorageOperations$, waitForTransaction } = await syncToRecs({
     +   world,
     +   config: storeConfig,
     +   address: networkConfig.worldAddress as Hex,
     +   publicClient,
     +   components: contractComponents,
     +   startBlock: BigInt(networkConfig.initialBlockNumber),
     +   indexerUrl: networkConfig.indexerUrl ?? undefined,
     + });

     + const worldContract = createContract({
     +   address: networkConfig.worldAddress as Hex,
     +   abi: IWorld__factory.abi,
     +   publicClient,
     +   walletClient: burnerWalletClient,
     + });
     ```

     ```diff
       // Request drip from faucet
     - const signer = result.network.signer.get();
     - if (networkConfig.faucetServiceUrl && signer) {
     -   const address = await signer.getAddress();
     + if (networkConfig.faucetServiceUrl) {
     +   const address = burnerAccount.address;
     ```

     ```diff
       const requestDrip = async () => {
     -   const balance = await signer.getBalance();
     +   const balance = await publicClient.getBalance({ address });
         console.info(`[Dev Faucet]: Player balance -> ${balance}`);
     -   const lowBalance = balance?.lte(utils.parseEther("1"));
     +   const lowBalance = balance < parseEther("1");
     ```

     You can remove the previous ethers `worldContract`, snap sync code, and fast transaction executor.

     The return of `setupNetwork` is a bit different than before, so you may have to do corresponding app changes.

     ```diff
     + return {
     +   world,
     +   components,
     +   playerEntity: encodeEntity({ address: "address" }, { address: burnerWalletClient.account.address }),
     +   publicClient,
     +   walletClient: burnerWalletClient,
     +   latestBlock$,
     +   blockStorageOperations$,
     +   waitForTransaction,
     +   worldContract,
     + };
     ```

  5. Update `createSystemCalls` with the new return type of `setupNetwork`.

     ```diff
       export function createSystemCalls(
     -   { worldSend, txReduced$, singletonEntity }: SetupNetworkResult,
     +   { worldContract, waitForTransaction }: SetupNetworkResult,
         { Counter }: ClientComponents
       ) {
          const increment = async () => {
     -      const tx = await worldSend("increment", []);
     -      await awaitStreamValue(txReduced$, (txHash) => txHash === tx.hash);
     +      const tx = await worldContract.write.increment();
     +      await waitForTransaction(tx);
            return getComponentValue(Counter, singletonEntity);
          };
     ```

  6. (optional) If you still need a clock, you can create it with:

     ```ts
     import { map, filter } from "rxjs";
     import { createClock } from "@latticexyz/network";

     const clock = createClock({
       period: 1000,
       initialTime: 0,
       syncInterval: 5000,
     });

     world.registerDisposer(() => clock.dispose());

     latestBlock$
       .pipe(
         map((block) => Number(block.timestamp) * 1000), // Map to timestamp in ms
         filter((blockTimestamp) => blockTimestamp !== clock.lastUpdateTime), // Ignore if the clock was already refreshed with this block
         filter((blockTimestamp) => blockTimestamp !== clock.currentTime), // Ignore if the current local timestamp is correct
       )
       .subscribe(clock.update); // Update the local clock
     ```

  If you're using the previous `LoadingState` component, you'll want to migrate to the new `SyncProgress`:

  ```ts
  import { SyncStep, singletonEntity } from "@latticexyz/store-sync/recs";

  const syncProgress = useComponentValue(SyncProgress, singletonEntity, {
    message: "Connecting",
    percentage: 0,
    step: SyncStep.INITIALIZE,
  });

  if (syncProgress.step === SyncStep.LIVE) {
    // we're live!
  }
  ```

  - `createContract` is a wrapper around [viem's `getContract`](https://viem.sh/docs/contract/getContract.html) but with better nonce handling for faster executing of transactions. It has the same arguments and return type as `getContract`.
  - `createNonceManager` helps track local nonces, used by `createContract`.

  Also renames `mudTransportObserver` to `transportObserver`.

  - `mudFoundry` chain with a transaction request formatter that temporarily removes max fees to work better with anvil `--base-fee 0`
  - `createBurnerAccount` that also temporarily removes max fees during transaction signing to work better with anvil `--base-fee 0`
  - `mudTransportObserver` that will soon let MUD Dev Tools observe transactions

  You can use them like:

  ```ts
  import { createBurnerAccount, mudTransportObserver } from "@latticexyz/common";
  import { mudFoundry } from "@latticexyz/common/chains";

  createWalletClient({
    account: createBurnerAccount(privateKey),

  Also adds a few utils we'll need in the indexer:

  - `bigIntMin` is similar to `Math.min` but for `bigint`s
  - `bigIntMax` is similar to `Math.max` but for `bigint`s
  - `bigIntSort` for sorting an array of `bigint`s
  - `chunk` to split an array into chunks
  - `wait` returns a `Promise` that resolves after specified number of milliseconds
