/*
ecs-snapshot computes and saves ECS state from a chain via snapshots, such that the client can
perform an initial sync to the ECS world state without having to process all ECS state changes
in form of events.

It exposes a [pkg.grpc.StartSnapshotServer] for getting the snapshot data and a gRPC-web HTTP server
wrapper to allow clients which are web applications to request snapshots with a POST request.

By default, ecs-snapshot attempts to connect to a local development chain and also by default,
ecs-snapshot indexes and snapshots all ECS state it finds via emitted events, which can be
restricted by specifying contract addresses.

Usage:

    ecs-snapshot [flags]

The flags are:

    -ws-url
        Websocket URL for chain to index and snapshot.
    -port
        Port to expose the gRPC server.
	-worldAddresses
		Comma-separated list of contract addresses to limit the indexing to. If left blank, index
		everything, otherwise, use this list as a filter.
