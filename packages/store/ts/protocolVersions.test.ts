/**
 * If these tests fail, it's because the protocol changed since the last ABI + version snapshot.
 *
 * The fix for this depends on your needs:
 *
 * - If the change was an intentional iteration of the protocol, increment the `version.sol` file according to semver.
 *   A new protocol snapshot will be created when you run this test again, which you should check into git.
 *
 * - If the protocol change is for a yet-to-be-release version (i.e. the version was bumped but packages not yet published),
 *   or if _only_ parameter/return value names changed (which do not affect calldata), then it's safe to just
 *   update the protocol snapshot for this version (`vitest -u`).
