 * @dev Systems are expected to be always called via the central World contract.
 * Depending on whether it is a root or non-root system, the call is performed via `delegatecall` or `call`.
 * Since Systems are expected to be stateless and only interact with the World state,
 * it is normally not necessary to prevent direct calls to the systems.
 * However, since the `CoreSystem` is known to always be registered as a root system in the World,
 * it is always expected to be delegatecalled, so we made this expectation explicit by reverting if it is not delegatecalled.
 *
 * @dev Based on OpenZeppelin's UUPSUpgradeable.sol
