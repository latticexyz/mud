# @latticexyz/std-contracts

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- c32c8e8f2: Removes `std-contracts` package. These were v1 contracts, now entirely replaced by our v2 tooling. See the [MUD docs](https://mud.dev/) for building with v2 or create a new project from our v2 templates with `pnpm create mud@next your-app-name`.

### Minor Changes

- a7b30c79b: Rename `MudV2Test` to `MudTest` and move from `@latticexyz/std-contracts` to `@latticexyz/store`.

  ```solidity
  // old import
  import { MudV2Test } from "@latticexyz/std-contracts/src/test/MudV2Test.t.sol";
  // new import
  import { MudTest } from "@latticexyz/store/src/MudTest.sol";
  ```

  Refactor `StoreSwitch` to use a storage slot instead of `function isStore()` to determine which contract is Store:

  - Previously `StoreSwitch` called `isStore()` on `msg.sender` to determine if `msg.sender` is a `Store` contract. If the call succeeded, the `Store` methods were called on `msg.sender`, otherwise the data was written to the own storage.
  - With this change `StoreSwitch` instead checks for an `address` in a known storage slot. If the address equals the own address, data is written to the own storage. If it is an external address, `Store` methods are called on this address. If it is unset (`address(0)`), store methods are called on `msg.sender`.
  - In practice this has the same effect as before: By default the `World` contracts sets its own address in `StoreSwitch`, while `System` contracts keep the Store address undefined, so `Systems` write to their caller (`World`) if they are executed via `call` or directly to the `World` storage if they are executed via `delegatecall`.
  - Besides gas savings, this change has two additional benefits:
    1. it is now possible for `Systems` to explicitly set a `Store` address to make them exclusive to that `Store` and
    2. table libraries can now be used in tests without having to provide an explicit `Store` argument, because the `MudTest` base contract redirects reads and writes to the internal `World` contract.
