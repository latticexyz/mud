### Major Changes

- [#1340](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/pull/1340) [`ce7125a1`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/commit/ce7125a1b97efd3db47c5ea1593d5a37ba143f64) Thanks [@holic](https://github.com/holic)! - Removes `solecs` package. These were v1 contracts, now entirely replaced by our v2 tooling. See the [MUD docs](https://mud.dev/) for building with v2 or create a new project from our v2 templates with `pnpm create mud@next your-app-name`.
